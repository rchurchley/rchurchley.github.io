<p>Cricket has a bit of a reputation for being hard to understand, but it&#8217;s actually a simpler game than the most popular North American sports.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s everything you need to know to enjoy a cricket match in 600 words or less.</p>



<span id="more-482"></span>



<p>Cricket is played on an oval field with a rectangular pitch in the middle. Two players on the batting team stand on either side of the pitch; the eleven players on the fielding team take up positions around the field.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1600" height="713" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/oval-jpg.webp" alt="A wide angle of a cricket match in progress." class="wp-image-487" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/oval-jpg.webp 1600w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/oval-800x357.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/oval-768x342.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/oval-1536x684.webp 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This wide angle shows nine of the England fielders in red (two are out of frame to the right), two New Zealand batters in black, and two umpires.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Runs</h2>



<p>The cricket ball is bowled overarm by a player on the fielding team and can bounce once. The batter hits the ball and switches ends with the other batter, scoring one run each time this happens.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Delivery.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A typical delivery is bowled and hit for a single run. The batter can choose not to run if they don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll make it in time.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If the batter hits the ball all the way to the boundary of the field, they score four runs automatically.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Boundary-Four.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>If they hit the ball really hard over the boundary, they score six runs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Boundary-Six.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A ball hit into the stands is worth six runs — but the crowd has to give it back so the same ball can be used for the whole innings.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wickets</h2>



<p>The goal of the fielding team is to get the batters out (&#8220;take their wickets&#8221;) before they score lots of runs.</p>



<p>The batter is <strong>out caught</strong> if they hit the ball and a fielder catches it before it hits the ground.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wicket-Caught.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Out caught is the most common form of dismissal in cricket.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The batter is <strong>out bowled</strong> if they miss and the ball hits the wicket behind them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wicket-Bowled.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Some games have fancy stumps and bails that light up when the wicket is broken.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The batter is <strong>out leg before wicket</strong> if they use their body to block the ball from hitting the wicket.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wicket-LBW.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A batter is out LBW if the ball hits their body and would have gone on to hit the wicket.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The batter is <strong>run out</strong> if they run and the fielding side breaks the wicket before they&#8217;re safe.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wicket-Run-out.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">To be safe, the batter&#8217;s body or bat must be touching the ground behind the white line.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The batter is <strong>out stumped</strong> if they come too far out, miss the ball, and get run out by the wicketkeeper.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wicket-Stumped.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The wicketkeeper stumps the batter by breaking the wicket with the ball or their hand holding the ball.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overs</h2>



<p>Every six balls<sup data-fn="99fed2f4-c6f7-45ae-9262-1e7a4f82165b" class="fn"><a href="#99fed2f4-c6f7-45ae-9262-1e7a4f82165b" id="99fed2f4-c6f7-45ae-9262-1e7a4f82165b-link">1</a></sup>, the fielders switch ends and a different player from the fielding team comes on to bowl. Six balls is also called an <strong>over</strong>.</p>



<p>Each team gets to bat for 20 overs<sup data-fn="99ce75d3-e31e-4847-9632-c32296b65a09" class="fn"><a href="#99ce75d3-e31e-4847-9632-c32296b65a09" id="99ce75d3-e31e-4847-9632-c32296b65a09-link">2</a></sup> or until they have lost ten wickets. Whichever team has the most runs after both sides bat wins.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Extras</h2>



<p>There are a bunch of rules that govern how the ball should be bowled. A violation results in a do-over, except the batting team is awarded an extra run and gets to keep any runs they scored off the illegal delivery.</p>



<p>A <strong>wide</strong> is signalled if the umpire judges that the ball was bowled too wide or too high for it to be reasonably hit.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Extra-Wide.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The umpire signals a wide by stretching their arms out.</figcaption></figure>



<p>A <strong>no ball</strong> is signalled if the bowler steps too far over the white line while bowling.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/No-ball.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Overstepping is the most common way a no ball is called against a bowler.</figcaption></figure>



<p>A no ball also turns the next ball into a &#8220;free hit&#8221;, meaning the batter is immune from getting out caught, bowled, stumped, or LBW off that ball.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Positions</h2>



<p>A typical team roster has some specialist <strong>batters</strong> who usually don&#8217;t bowl, some specialist <strong>bowlers</strong> who aren&#8217;t expected to get lots of runs, and some <strong>all-rounders</strong> who are good at both batting and bowling.</p>



<p>There are two main bowling styles: <strong>fast bowlers</strong> rely on the speed of their deliveries while <strong>spin bowlers</strong> deliver slow but tricky balls.</p>



<p>Each team has a <strong>wicketkeeper</strong> who stops the balls that get past the batter. You can recognize the wicketkeeper as the only fielder who wears gloves.</p>



<p>Fielders can be deployed anywhere, subject to a few restrictions.<sup data-fn="1d6b6fa8-d61b-403f-b70b-2587dd8c9711" class="fn"><a href="#1d6b6fa8-d61b-403f-b70b-2587dd8c9711" id="1d6b6fa8-d61b-403f-b70b-2587dd8c9711-link">3</a></sup> Commentators describe fielding positions using funny names like slip, gully, mid-off, square leg, and third man. You don&#8217;t need to memorize these.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Scoreboard</h2>



<p>A typical TV broadcast overlay displays the following information:</p>



<ul>
<li>The batting team&#8217;s current run total and wickets lost.<sup data-fn="c2ccf6cd-bb84-4278-a55f-12365bf3377f" class="fn"><a href="#c2ccf6cd-bb84-4278-a55f-12365bf3377f" id="c2ccf6cd-bb84-4278-a55f-12365bf3377f-link">4</a></sup></li>



<li>The number of overs completed or the number of balls remaining.</li>



<li>The<strong> </strong>current batters&#8217; names, runs scored, and balls faced, with some indication of which batter is facing the next ball.</li>



<li>The current bowler.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1600" height="900" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/scoreline-jpg.webp" alt="A cricket TV broadcast. The overlay reads as follows: ENG 101-2. 12/20. Run Rate 8.42. Beaumont 47* (39), Jones 23 (10). NZ Kasperek 1-24 (2)." class="wp-image-492" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/scoreline-jpg.webp 1600w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/scoreline-800x450.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/scoreline-768x432.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/scoreline-1536x864.webp 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This overlay indicates that England are batting and have scored 101 runs for the loss of 2 wickets. It is the 12th over in a 20-over match. Beaumont has scored 47 runs off 39 balls and is facing the current ball. Jones has scored 23 runs off 10 balls. The current bowler is New Zealand&#8217;s Kasperek, who has taken 1 wicket and given up 24 runs in 2 overs this match.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When the first team is batting, the overlay may show the current <strong>run rate</strong> (average runs per over).</p>



<p>When the second team is batting, the overlay shows either the <strong>target score</strong> needed to win, or the remaining runs needed to reach the target.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>That&#8217;s all you need to follow and enjoy a cricket match! All that&#8217;s left to learn is a few bits of jargon, the names of the players, and the details of whatever tournament or competition you want to follow. You&#8217;ll pick up all of those as you go.</p>



<p>Some tournaments worth following are:</p>



<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup">Men&#8217;s Twenty20 World Cup</a> (this June).</li>



<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Women%27s_T20_World_Cup">Women&#8217;s Twenty20 World Cup</a> (this October). </li>

</ul>



<p>National sides often play <a href="https://www.icc-cricket.com/fixtures-results">series against each other</a> as well.</p>



<p>If you want to watch cricket, most series are carried in Canada by subscription streaming service <a href="https://www.willow.tv/">Willow TV</a>. You can also follow live text summaries and scorecards on sites like <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/">ESPN Cricinfo</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A while ago I arbitrarily decided that I needed a favourite three-digit number (don’t ask) and ended up choosing 216. It’s a nice cube number —&nbsp;6×6×6&nbsp;— and can also be expressed as a sum of three smaller cubes:</p>



<div class="wp-block-katex-display-block katex-eq" data-katex-display="true"><pre>6^3 = 5^3 + 4^3 + 3^3</pre></div>



<span id="more-163"></span>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/216_(number)">Wikipedia article for the number</a>&nbsp;has&nbsp;<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Plato_number.svg">a diagram</a>&nbsp;showing one way to reassemble a 6×6×6 cube into three smaller cubes, but I’ve been playing around looking for other, more aesthetically pleasing methods. Here’s one I found.</p>



<p>First, we break the 6×6×6 cube into its 4×4×4 interior, six 4×4×1 faces, twelve 4×1×1 edges, and eight 1×1×1 corners<sup data-fn="3dde39ee-627c-411e-9090-1effecda7ff5" class="fn"><a href="#3dde39ee-627c-411e-9090-1effecda7ff5" id="3dde39ee-627c-411e-9090-1effecda7ff5-link">1</a></sup>: i.e.,</p>



<div class="wp-block-katex-display-block katex-eq" data-katex-display="true"><pre>6^3 = 4^3 + 6\cdot 4^2 + 12\cdot 4^1 + 8 \cdot 4^0</pre></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async"  src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/216.svg" alt="An exploded-view diagram of a cube separated into an interior, faces, edges, and corners." class="wp-image-208"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Decomposing the cube according to its polytope boundaries.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The 4×4×1 faces can be combined with seven of the edges and one of the corners to build a 5×5×5 cube. The remaining five edges can be split into ten 2×1×1 chunks and arranged with the remaining seven corners to form a 3×3×3 cube.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async"  src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rearrange.svg" alt="An exploded-view diagram of a 3×3×3 cube and a 5×5×5 cube using the pieces of the 6×6×6 cube from before." class="wp-image-209"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Rearranging the pieces into smaller cubes.</figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async"  src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cubes.svg" alt="The unexploded view of the 3×3×3, 4×4×4, and 5×5×5 cubes made from the pieces of the 6×6×6 cube." class="wp-image-210"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The final three cubes.</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are many more ways to construct three cubes from the pieces of a 6×6×6 cube. What’s your favourite?</p>


<ol class="wp-block-footnotes"><li id="3dde39ee-627c-411e-9090-1effecda7ff5">As an aside, this decomposition can be done with any size cube and even in any number of dimensions. An <em>n</em>-dimensional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube">hypercube</a> of size <em>x</em>≥2 breaks into <em>k</em>-dimensional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope">polytope</a> boundary chunks as <em>x</em><sup><em>n</em></sup><strong> </strong>=<strong> </strong>∑​<strong> </strong>2<sup><em>n</em>−<em>k</em></sup><strong> </strong>C(<em>n</em>,<strong> </strong><em>k</em>)<strong> </strong>(<em>x</em>−2)<sup><em>k</em></sup> , where C(<em>n</em>,<strong> </strong><em>k</em>) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient">binomial coefficient</a>. <a href="#3dde39ee-627c-411e-9090-1effecda7ff5-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote reference 1"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />︎</a></li></ol>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This means that the cosmology of the <em>Zelda</em> universe is significantly different from our own; if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_Revolution">Copernicus</a> was Hylian he’d have stuck with a geocentric model.<sup data-fn="2c82e157-3611-45f1-a3f1-1f56bc34e73b" class="fn"><a href="#2c82e157-3611-45f1-a3f1-1f56bc34e73b" id="2c82e157-3611-45f1-a3f1-1f56bc34e73b-link">1</a></sup></p>



<p>That’s not the only astronomical oddity in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. <strong>The sun’s position at sunrise and sunset doesn’t make sense</strong>. On Earth, the sun doesn’t always rise and set <em>exactly</em> in the east and west. In the (boreal) summer, the sun rises and sets further north, providing us in the Northern Hemisphere with more hours of sunlight each day.</p>



<p>Here in the Vancouver summer, the sun currently rises 38° north of east and sets 38° north of west. In <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> the sun rises around 4:00 and sets around 9:00,<sup data-fn="9c229a3c-bc95-4c91-90c6-3cc9a8526925" class="fn"><a href="#9c229a3c-bc95-4c91-90c6-3cc9a8526925" id="9c229a3c-bc95-4c91-90c6-3cc9a8526925-link">2</a></sup> so you’d expect them to happen at similar angles instead of due east and west.</p>



<p>This is more evidence towards a geocentric model of Hylian cosmology, since the day-night cycle can be explained if the sun’s orbit around the world intersects Hyrule but its center does not.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/24hours.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A 24-hour cycle of sunrise and moonrise.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The strangest phenomenon I noticed is the fact that <strong>moon only appears at night</strong>. Sure, we culturally associate the moon with night, but in reality it’s out during the day half the time. This is what gives the moon <a href="https://moon.nasa.gov/moon-in-motion/phases-eclipses-supermoons/moon-phases/">its phases</a>; the closer the moon is to the sun in the sky, the less of it appears illuminated to us on Earth. If the moon always rises and sets at the same time of day, its phases cannot be explained as the reflected light of the sun!</p>



<p>The simplest explanation would be that Link is observing the rotation of a moon with one luminescent side, but I looked closely and the half-moon has the same face as the full moon. This means that, like Earth’s moon, the Hylian moon is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking">tidally locked</a><sup data-fn="413f2cee-ede6-45ee-a0fe-4e09834d120a" class="fn"><a href="#413f2cee-ede6-45ee-a0fe-4e09834d120a" id="413f2cee-ede6-45ee-a0fe-4e09834d120a-link">3</a></sup> and always shows the same face.</p>

<p>My best theory is that the moon is made of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence">fluorescent</a> material and is orbited by a small body that emits ultraviolet or other high-energy light in the non-visible spectrum. Do you have an alternative headcanon theory?</p>

<p>I recently went for a walk in təmtəmíxʷtən (Belcarra), and when I got to… wait, what’s that weird derelict building in the distance?</p>



<span id="more-151"></span>



<p>Is it an abandoned hotel? No, there’s no way to get there by land. An old naval fortress? No, the location doesn’t make any strategic sense. A hydroelectric dam? Where’s the water behind it?</p>



<p>As it turns out, it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a power plant!&nbsp;<a href="https://montecristomagazine.com/community/the-buntzen-lake-powerhouses">Buntzen generating station #2</a>, completed in 1914, was built to supplement the output of BC’s first-ever hydroelectric plant up-inlet. Both stations were powered by water delivered by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penstock">penstocks</a>&nbsp;from Buntzen Lake, which in turn was supplied with water from Coquitlam Lake via a 4km-long tunnel.</p>



<p>Buntzen station #1&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bchydro.com/energy-in-bc/operations/our-facilities/lower-mainland.html">is still functional</a>&nbsp;and supplies 60 megawatts of power to the Metro Vancouver area. Buntzen #2 was shut down at the turn of the millennium and serves as a historic curiosity for kayakers in səl̓ilw̓ət (Indian Arm).</p>

<p>I’m on a quest to explore the creeks and waterways of Vancouver, Burnaby, and New Westminster. First, I need to understand how the topography of my neighbourhood determines the flow of water and the formation of streams.</p>



<span id="more-134"></span>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="900" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/contours-jpeg.webp" alt="A topographic map of the Burrard Peninsula." class="wp-image-237" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/contours-jpeg.webp 1600w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/contours-800x450.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/contours-768x432.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/contours-1536x864.webp 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A topographic map of the Burrard Peninsula.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Three main topological features define how water flows in the Vancouver-Burnaby-New West area:</p>



<ul>
<li>a chain of hills running along səl̓ilw̓ət (Burrard Inlet) from East Vancouver to Coquitlam, including Capitol Hill and lhuḵw’lkuḵw’áyten (Burnaby Mountain);</li>



<li>a ridge extending from t̕θəcəliʔqʷ (UBC) to sχʷeyəməɬ (New Westminster) along the southern half of the peninsula, with peaks at Little Mountain and the Metrotown area; and</li>



<li>weirdly enough, a barely perceptible incline between Nanaimo Street and Renfrew Street in East Vancouver.</li>
</ul>



<p>These features divide the Burrard Peninsula into four watersheds, which determine where a falling raindrop will flow</p>



<ul>
<li>north, into səl̓ilw̓ət (Burrard Inlet),</li>



<li>northwest, into False Creek/English Bay,</li>



<li>south, into stal̓əw̓ (the Fraser River), or</li>



<li>east, through Still Creek, Burnaby Lake, and the Brunette River, before returning west via stal̓əw̓ (the Fraser River).</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="900" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vancouver-watersheds.png" alt="A topographic map of the Burrard Peninsula, divided into four coloured regions as described above." class="wp-image-236" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vancouver-watersheds.png 1600w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vancouver-watersheds-800x450.png 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vancouver-watersheds-768x432.png 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vancouver-watersheds-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The main watersheds of the Burrard Peninsula.</figcaption></figure>



<p>(More detailed watershed maps can be found on the websites of the&nbsp;<a href="https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/one-water-watershed-characterization.pdf">City of Vancouver</a> and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.burnaby.ca/sites/default/files/acquiadam/2021-07/Waterways%20of%20Burnaby.pdf">City of Burnaby</a>.)</p>



<p>Most of the&nbsp;<a href="http://hdl.handle.net/11272/IKHNQ">historic streams</a>&nbsp;of Vancouver have been developed over, so rainwater now is mainly conveyed through storm drains and groundwater. In contrast, Burnaby still has plenty of streams carrying rain through its watersheds.</p>



<p>I’ll be exploring these streams and attempting to trace them from source to mouth. Stay tuned for more!</p>

<p>Recently I&#8217;ve been spending my spare time doing two things: solving cryptic crosswords and playing <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>. The next logical step, then, is to try my hand at compiling my own cryptic crossword themed after the game!</p>



<span id="more-319"></span>



<p>If you haven&#8217;t tried one before, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptic_crossword">cryptic crossword</a> is a crossword puzzle in which each clue is itself a word puzzle. A cryptic clue is usually misleading if taken at face value, but conceals a definition and a secondary indication (usually wordplay) of the correct answer. For example:</p>



<details class="wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow"><summary>A gym leader in Cinnabar was inflamed (5)</summary>
<p>The answer is <strong>RAGED</strong>, meaning &#8220;was inflamed&#8221;.</p>



<p>At first reading, it seems like this clue refers to the fiery Cinnabar Island Gym Leader <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Blaine">Blaine</a> from Pokémon Red and Blue, but the hidden real definition is only the last two words, &#8220;was inflamed&#8221;.</p>



<p>The remainder of the clue is wordplay that hints at the answer: &#8220;Cinnabar&#8221; means RED and &#8220;gym leader&#8221; can be interpreted as &#8220;the first letter of gym&#8221;, so &#8220;A gym leader in Cinnabar&#8221; reduces to &#8220;A G in RED&#8221; — hence, RAGED.</p>
</details>



<p>Cryptic clues can be even more complicated and include anagrams, homophones, obscure abbreviations, and all sorts of other devices. Or they can be as simple as a bad pun.</p>



<details class="wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow"><summary>Feet passed down through generations? (7)</summary>
<p>The answer is <strong>LEGENDS</strong>, which are &#8220;passed down through generations&#8221;. What do feet have to do with anything? Well, they&#8217;re LEG ENDS, of course&#8230;</p>
</details>



<p>You&#8217;ll need to be a Pokémon fan to appreciate all of the surface readings in this puzzle, but don&#8217;t worry if you aren&#8217;t — none of the clues require any specific knowledge of Pokémon to solve. Once you&#8217;re done, you can go to page 2 to check the solutions and see how you did. Enjoy!</p>

<pre class="wp-block-verse">Do you got plans tonight?<br>Song’s “a couple of hundred miles from Japan”, but I —<br>I was thinking other lyrics mean that can’t be right,<br>And I can’t get this off of my mind.</pre>



<span id="more-124"></span>



<p>Shawn Mendes’ song “Lost in Japan” has had me geographically confused since I first heard it&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zb_VFx3iyjg">covered by Scary Pockets</a>. If you haven’t listened to the lyrics, the song is about a person who is thinking about their crush and the possibility of taking a last-minute flight to Japan to see them. As the chorus goes:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Do you got plans tonight?<br>I’m a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I<br>I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight<br>‘Cause I can’t get you off my mind</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The question I can’t get off my mind is: where is the song supposed to be taking place? From the chorus, we can infer that</p>



<ol>
<li>the crush is somewhere in Japan</li>



<li>the singer is outside of Japan, and</li>



<li>both people are close enough to an international airport for one to entertain the idea of flying to the other’s hotel.</li>
</ol>



<p>The most likely candidates for airports within “a couple hundred miles from Japan” are in South Korea.</p>

<p>When I first considered the geography of the song, I was satisfied with that answer: couple of hundred miles, South Korea, that sounds about right. But then I noticed the opening lyrics:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>All it’d take is one flight<br>We’d be in the same time zone</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That would seem to rule out South Korea, which is in the same time zone as Japan. With the closest locations out of the picture, we have to stretch our interpretation of the song. Here are the possibilities I can see.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-singer-could-be-in-shanghai">The singer could be in Shanghai</h2>



<p>Shanghai is 500 miles (in different directions) from Okinawa and Kyūshū Islands.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Pudong_International_Airport">Shanghai Pudong International Airport</a>&nbsp;was the eighth-busiest airport in the world when “Lost in Japan” was released, and has plenty of routes to both Naha and Nagasaki.</p>



<p>This is probably the most plausible answer if we make the thematically appropriate assumption that the lovestruck protagonist is downplaying the distance in order to convince themself that taking a last-minute flight is a good idea.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-singer-could-be-in-vladivostok">The singer could be in Vladivostok</h2>



<p>Vladivostok is also within 500 miles of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Chitose_Airport">New Chitose Airport</a>&nbsp;in Sapporo. This possibility is pretty funny, but unfortunately it’s ruled out by logistics. The only regular flight I could find between the two was only opened by Ural Airlines after “Lost in Japan” was released, and did not last long before world events shut it down permanently.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-singer-could-be-in-taipei">The singer could be in Taipei</h2>



<p>There’s only one location that geographically fits the lyrics exactly: our protagonist is in Taiwan, and their crush is less than 200 miles away in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishigaki,_Okinawa">Ishigaki</a>&nbsp;on Japan’s southwesternmost inhabited archipelago.</p>



<p>With a creative enough interpretation, this is also consistent with the second verse:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Do I gotta convince you<br>That you shouldn’t fall asleep?<br>It’ll only be a couple hours<br>And I’m about to leave.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The singer is presumably in a hurry to leave because they have just checked the timetable for the only direct flight from Taipei to Ishigaki, which runs on Wednesdays and Saturdays during the tourist season. The flight is short enough that “a couple hours” is realistic if customs is quick.</p>



<p>The line about falling asleep is, of course, a request for the romantic interest to skip their usual afternoon nap, since China Airlines flight 124 arrives at 11:35am.</p>

<p>While doing research for the game, Librande was faced with quantifying our land use decisions.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>When I started measuring out our local grocery store, which I don’t think of as being that big, I was blown away by how much more space was parking lot rather than actual store.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For example, here in Vancouver the&nbsp;<a href="https://vancouver.ca/your-government/parking-bylaw.aspx">parking bylaw</a>&nbsp;requires one 14m² parking space for every 20m² of supermarket floor space. Adding the necessary lanes to allow cars to get in and out, this law practically guarantees that grocery stores will be more parking lot than store.</p>

<p>In 1852, then-student Francis Guthrie wondered any if possible map required more than four colours. By the end of the century, Guthrie and his fellow colonists had drawn a map on Africa that needed five.</p>



<span id="more-16"></span>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem">Four-Colour Theorem</a>&nbsp;says that, no matter what the borders on your map are, you only need four colours to make sure that neighbouring regions are coloured differently. The theorem doesn’t apply if you let some regions claim other disconnected regions as their own, and in fact&nbsp;the map&nbsp;of European claims on Africa required five colours by the end of the 19th century.</p>

<p><em>Pokémon Gold</em> and <em>Silver</em> introduced the roaming legendary beasts: three one-of-a-kind Pokémon that move from route to route instead of sticking to a fixed habitat. Catching a roaming Pokémon amounts to winning a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pursuit-evasion">graph pursuit game</a> — so what can we learn about it from the latest mathematical results?</p>



<span id="more-263"></span>



<p>To review the Pokémon mechanics, each species can normally be found in a handful of fixed habitats. If you want to catch Abra, you go to Route 24; if you&#8217;re looking for Jigglypuff, head to Route 46.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="960" height="432" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jigglypuff-location.webp" alt="A screenshot of Jigglypuff's Pokédex entry and map locations." class="wp-image-420" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jigglypuff-location.webp 960w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jigglypuff-location-800x360.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jigglypuff-location-768x346.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jigglypuff can always be found on Route 46.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The legendary Entei, Raikou, and Suicune<sup data-fn="53b351db-4942-4cbe-920f-55bd9d054c33" class="fn"><a href="#53b351db-4942-4cbe-920f-55bd9d054c33" id="53b351db-4942-4cbe-920f-55bd9d054c33-link">1</a></sup> are different. There&#8217;s only one of each species, each situated on a random route. Each time the player character moves to a new location, the roaming Pokémon each move to a randomly-selected route adjacent to the one they were just on. In graph theory terms, the player and Pokémon are engaged in a pursuit game where the Pokémon&#8217;s strategy follows a random walk.</p>



<p>The study of graph pursuit games is a fascinating and active <a href="https://math.ryerson.ca/~abonato/copsandrobbers.html">area of research</a>. Classically, researchers have asked how many &#8220;cops&#8221; it takes to guarantee the capture of an evasive &#8220;robber&#8221; travelling around a graph. Depending on the graph, many cops might be needed to catch a clever robber; there is a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.3385">deep open problem</a> about the worst-case cop numbers of large graphs.</p>



<p>Because the graph corresponding to the Pokémon region of Johto contains a long cycle as an isometric subgraph, its cop number is more than one — in other words, it&#8217;s possible that a roaming Pokémon could theoretically evade a lone Pokémon trainer forever! Fortunately, the legendary beasts play randomly, not perfectly, so the worst-case scenario doesn&#8217;t apply.</p>



<p>A random walk in an arbitrary <em>n</em>-vertex, <em>m</em>-edge graph <a href="https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/CMSC5734/LovaszRadnomWalks93.pdf">can be expected</a> to spend deg(<em>v</em>)/(2<em>m</em>) of its time at each location <em>v</em>, and to visit the whole graph after <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/rsa.3240060106">at most</a> roughly 4<em>n</em><sup>3</sup>/27 steps. So any trainer who isn&#8217;t actively trying to avoid Entei should end up bumping into it eventually — and an intelligent trainer should be able to do much better.</p>



<p>The first place to start is the &#8220;greedy&#8221; strategy I originally tried as a kid: every time Entei moves, check the map, and move to any route that gets me closer to them. After Entei makes its random move, the distance between us could be unchanged (with Entei’s move offsetting mine), or it could go down by one, or it could go down by two in the lucky 1/Δ chance that Entei moves towards me. If I start at a distance of ℓ steps away from Entei and get lucky ℓ/2 times, I’ll have caught up — so using a negative binomial distribution bound,</p>



<div class="wp-block-katex-display-block katex-eq" data-katex-display="true"><pre>\text{E[capture time]} \leq \frac{\Delta \ell}{2}.</pre></div>



<p>In the grand scheme of things, this isn’t too bad — especially if Δ is low. But it still takes a frustratingly large time for a 12-year-old, and in general it’s possible to do better.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="900" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/professor-elm-meyniel.webp" alt="The Pokémon character Professor Elm in front of a chalkboard showing the cop number of three graphs." class="wp-image-421" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/professor-elm-meyniel.webp 1600w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/professor-elm-meyniel-800x450.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/professor-elm-meyniel-768x432.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/professor-elm-meyniel-1536x864.webp 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Professor Elm ponders some results and conjectures about graph pursuit games.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Recently, Peter Winkler and Natasha Komarov <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4559">found a strategy</a> for general graphs which gives a better bound on the expected capture time. Somewhat counterintuitively, it involves aiming for where the robber was — rather than their current location — until the cop is very close to catching him. The Komarov-Winkler strategy has an expected capture time of <em>n</em>+o(<em>n</em>), where <em>n</em> is the number of locations on the map. This is essentially best possible on certain graphs, and is better than the above Δℓ/2 bound when the graph has vertices with large degree.</p>



<p>For graphs without high-degree vertices — like the Pokémon world map — it is possible that a simpler solution could beat the Komarov–Winkler strategy. The problem is: simpler strategies may not be simpler to analyse. In <a href="https://www.math.cmu.edu/~nkomarov/NKThesis.pdf">her PhD thesis</a>, Natasha wondered whether a greedy algorithm with random tiebreakers could guarantee <em>n</em>+o(<em>n</em>) expected capture time. It is an open question to find a general bound for the &#8220;randomly greedy&#8221; strategy&#8217;s expected performance that would prove her right.</p>

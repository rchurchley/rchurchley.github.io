<p>Recently I&#8217;ve been spending my spare time doing two things: solving cryptic crosswords and playing <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>. The next logical step, then, is to try my hand at compiling my own cryptic crossword themed after the game!</p>



<span id="more-319"></span>



<p>If you haven&#8217;t tried one before, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptic_crossword">cryptic crossword</a> is a crossword puzzle in which each clue is itself a word puzzle. A cryptic clue is usually misleading if taken at face value, but conceals a definition and a secondary indication (usually wordplay) of the correct answer. For example:</p>



<details class="wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow"><summary>A gym leader in Cinnabar was inflamed (5)</summary>
<p>The answer is <strong>RAGED</strong>, meaning &#8220;was inflamed&#8221;.</p>



<p>At first reading, it seems like this clue refers to the fiery Cinnabar Island Gym Leader <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Blaine">Blaine</a> from Pokémon Red and Blue, but the hidden real definition is only the last two words, &#8220;was inflamed&#8221;.</p>



<p>The remainder of the clue is wordplay that hints at the answer: &#8220;Cinnabar&#8221; means RED and &#8220;gym leader&#8221; can be interpreted as &#8220;the first letter of gym&#8221;, so &#8220;A gym leader in Cinnabar&#8221; reduces to &#8220;A G in RED&#8221; — hence, RAGED.</p>
</details>



<p>Cryptic clues can be even more complicated and include anagrams, homophones, obscure abbreviations, and all sorts of other devices. Or they can be as simple as a bad pun.</p>



<details class="wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow"><summary>Feet passed down through generations? (7)</summary>
<p>The answer is <strong>LEGENDS</strong>, which are &#8220;passed down through generations&#8221;. What do feet have to do with anything? Well, they&#8217;re LEG ENDS, of course&#8230;</p>
</details>



<p>You&#8217;ll need to be a Pokémon fan to appreciate all of the surface readings in this puzzle, but don&#8217;t worry if you aren&#8217;t — none of the clues require any specific knowledge of Pokémon to solve. Once you&#8217;re done, you can go to page 2 to check the solutions and see how you did. Enjoy!</p>

<span id="more-317"></span>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="1200" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/owlbeamer-sample.webp" alt="A sample slide using the Owl Beamer color theme" class="wp-image-651" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/owlbeamer-sample.webp 1600w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/owlbeamer-sample-800x600.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/owlbeamer-sample-768x576.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/owlbeamer-sample-1536x1152.webp 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>Owl was designed with three guiding principles in mind:</p>



<p><strong>Simple colours = no distractions</strong></p>



<p>Owl uses black, white, and slight grey tones for the structural elements of each Beamer frame, putting the focus of each slide on your content.</p>



<p><strong>Dark and bright rooms, dark and light themes</strong></p>



<p>A white background is best for visibility in brightly-lit rooms, whereas a black one can be easier on the eyes in rooms with low ambient lighting. Owl provides both dark and light themes, easily configurable with the package options.</p>



<p><strong>A palette optimized for common projectors</strong></p>



<p>Business and university projectors are often calibrated with an extremely bright green channel and very dim red and blue channels. Owl redefines the basic colour names <code>red</code>, <code>green</code>, <code>blue</code>, <code>yellow</code>, <code>violet</code>, <code>brown</code>, <code>orange</code>, and <code>cyan</code> to attractive hues that are still visible on these projectors.</p>



<p>Owl is available <a href="https://www.ctan.org/pkg/beamercolorthemeowl">on CTAN</a> and comes bundled with the latest TeX Live distribution.</p>

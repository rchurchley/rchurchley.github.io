<p>&#8220;Hydrogen&#8221; in German is <em>Wasserstoff</em>, which sounds hilarious except it&#8217;s just a literal translation of the Greek hydro-gen!</p>



<p>Most chemical elements are more or less the same in German and English. The fun exceptions are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Wasserstoff (Hydrogen); &#8220;water stuff&#8221; is a literal translation.</li>



<li>Kohlenstoff (Carbon); &#8220;coal stuff&#8221; is a literal translation.</li>



<li>Stickstoff (Nitrogen); &#8220;suffocation stuff&#8221;, apparently because it&#8217;s the non-oxygen part of air, is a German original.</li>



<li>Sauerstoff (Oxygen); &#8220;sour stuff&#8221; is a literal translation.</li>
</ul>



<p>German also has Natrium (Sodium), Kalium (Potassium), Wofram (Tungsten), Quecksilber (Mercury), and Blei (Lead).</p>

<p>Julius Caesar‚Äôs given name was Gaius. &#8220;Julius&#8221; and &#8220;Caesar&#8221; were both family names (Caesar being a branch of the Julia family).</p>



<p>In his time, he was referred to as&nbsp;<em>Gaius Caesar</em> or simply as <em>Caesar</em> by <a href="https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Commentarii_de_bello_Gallico">himself</a> and <a href="https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Pro_Marcello">his contemporaries</a>. Calling him &#8220;Julius Caesar&#8221; would have been redundant since every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julii_Caesares">Caesar</a> was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_gens">Julius</a>.</p>



<p>The Romans had a lot of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_naming_conventions">traditions</a>&nbsp;around names.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Julius_Caesar_(name)">Gaius Julius Caesar</a>&nbsp;inherited his name from his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.</p>



<p>Caesar‚Äôs great-nephew&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Gaius Octavius Thurinus</a>&nbsp;also took the name Gaius Julius Caesar when he inherited the assassinated dictator‚Äôs estate. To prevent confusion, he‚Äôs often called&nbsp;<em>Octavianus</em>, which is more or less the ancient Roman equivalent to &#8220;the artist formerly known as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)">Prince</a>&#8220;. The emperor&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula">Caligula</a>, Octavian‚Äôs great-grandson, was also named Gaius Caesar; we know him by a nickname he received as a small child.</p>

<p>Between cabbage, lettuce, maple, and holly, two plants are in the rosid clade (related to roses) and two are in the asterid clade (related to sunflowers). Can you guess which is which?</p>



<span id="more-143"></span>



<p>I would have guessed that the trees might be related to a woody rose bush, while the leafy greens would be closer to broad-leaved sunflowers. I would have been wrong. Plants are&nbsp;<em>much</em>&nbsp;weirder than that.</p>



<p>In fact, cabbages are much more closely related to maple trees than they are to lettuce;&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica_oleracea">cabbage</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple">maples</a>&nbsp;are both&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosids">rosids</a>. Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly">holly trees</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lettuce">lettuce</a>&nbsp;are both&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterids">asterids</a>.</p>



<p>As it turns out, a lot of the categories we use to think about plants ‚Äî trees, bushes, berries, vegetables, and so on ‚Äî are not particularly unique from an genetic perspective. Biologist Georgia Ray&nbsp;<a href="https://eukaryotewritesblog.com/2021/05/02/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-tree/">explains</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>On the evolutionary tree of plants, trees are regularly interspersed with things that are&nbsp;<em>absolutely, 100%</em>&nbsp;not trees. This means that, for instance:</p>



<ul>
<li>The common ancestor of a maple and a mulberry tree was not a tree.</li>



<li>The common ancestor of a stinging nettle and a strawberry plant was a tree.</li>



<li>And this is true for most trees or non-trees that you can think of.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>Because of this, there are plenty of plant lists you can play &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_of_These_Things_(Is_Not_Like_the_Others)">One of these things is not like the others</a>&#8221;&nbsp;with where the intuitive answer is very different from the phylogenetic answer.</p>

<p>Every new emoji starts with a formal proposal justifying why it should exist. The proposal for <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1faf5.png" alt="ü´µ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> starts with four pages of the history of people pointing at the viewer in art.</p>



<span id="more-141"></span>



<p>Only a few emoji are accepted every year, but anyone can submit suggestions for new emoji. For example:</p>



<ul>
<li><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1fabc.png" alt="ü™º" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2021/21217-jellyfish-emoji.pdf">proposed</a>&nbsp;by marine biologists.</li>



<li><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1fa97.png" alt="ü™ó" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2019/19087-accordion-emoji.pdf">proposed</a>&nbsp;by accordion historian&nbsp;<a href="https://accordionuprising.wordpress.com/about/">Bruce Triggs</a></li>



<li><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1fad8.png" alt="ü´ò" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> was¬†<a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2020/20226-beans-emoji.pdf">proposed</a>¬†by someone who just enjoys &#8220;chowing down on the occasional bowl of baked beans.&#8221;</li>
</ul>



<p>To address the Unicode Consortium‚Äôs&nbsp;<a href="https://unicode.org/emoji/proposals.html">emoji selection criteria</a>, you‚Äôll find proposals arguing things like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2016/16304-fantasy-creatures.pdf">mermaids are 522% more popular than goblins</a>&nbsp;or that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2019/19103-teapot-emoji.pdf">teapots are not too similar to teacups</a>. Older emoji didn‚Äôt go through the same kind of selection process, which is presumably why there are three separate emoji for optical computer media: <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4c0.png" alt="üìÄ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4bf.png" alt="üíø" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4bd.png" alt="üíΩ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />.</p>



<p>You can find most emoji proposals linked from their&nbsp;<a href="https://emojipedia.org/">Emojipedia</a>&nbsp;page. Here are a few interesting or funny submissions I‚Äôve seen. (All quotations&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sixthcircuitappellateblog.com/uncategorized/a-brief-history-and-status-of-cleaned-up-in-the-sixth-circuit/#page=1">cleaned up</a>.)</p>

<p>Since then, several yo-yo booms have swept the world, often on 7 year cycles of boom and bust. Some may say that the yo-yo has its ups and downs.</p>

<p>Currently, emojis only depict people assigned female at birth in a role of pregnancy. If emojis are designed in a manner to be as inclusive as possible this emoji should present its gender more ambiguously.</p>

<p>This picture illustrates the danger of poorly-designed streets, which the Swedish government set out to improve in the 1990s. It was originally created by Swedish artist¬†<a href="http://www.jilg.com/">Karl Jilg</a>, who was commissioned by the¬†<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Road_Administration">Swedish Road Administration</a>¬†to explain new¬†<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_Zero">Vision Zero</a>¬†initiatives.</p>



<span id="more-132"></span>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-23176-7_8-1">ideas</a>&nbsp;behind the initiatives were that</p>



<ol>
<li>The responsibility for preventing deaths and injuries on the road transportation system partly rests with the people who design that infrastructure, and</li>



<li>Deaths and injuries on the road ultimately come down to kinetic energy.</li>
</ol>



<p>The picture is intended to turn the kinetic energy of a moving car into a height to show the consequences of simple human mistakes in the road system. Research shows that the highest acceptable speed on a street with active users like this is 30km/h.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="800" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jilg-sidewalk-jpeg.webp" alt="An illustration of a city block with bottomless pits for streets." class="wp-image-227" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jilg-sidewalk-jpeg.webp 600w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jilg-sidewalk-450x600.webp 450w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Pedestrians navigate the dangerous chasms of city streets. (Karl Jilg / V√§gverket)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The image has been widely shared, thanks in part to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/11/18/7236471/cars-pedestrians-sidewalks-roads">a 2014 Vox article</a>&nbsp;that used it to call attention to other pedestrian-hostile aspects about many cities‚Äô street designs:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Most roads in the US are built for cars, not for pedestrians. This brilliant illustration shows just how lopsided the the proportions of a normal urban street corner really are.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The city sidewalk picture is just one of a series of four that Jilg illustrated for the Swedish government. The other one I found is set on a highway.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="800" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jilg-canyon-jpeg.webp" alt="An illustration of a car speeding along a road high in the mountains." class="wp-image-228" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jilg-canyon-jpeg.webp 600w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jilg-canyon-450x600.webp 450w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A car moving at highway speeds has a lot of kinetic energy. (Karl Jilg / V√§gverket)</figcaption></figure>



<p>I‚Äôm not sure whether Jilg did any calculations to create these, but a head-on collision between two cars at highway speed is approximately equivalent to a single car being dropped from a height of 200m. Sweden added median barriers to many highways in the late ‚Äô90s, which reduced the incidence of head-on collisions and the risk of fatalities by 80%.</p>



<p>I have unfortunately not been able to find the other two illustrations in the set. Jilg has, however, done other work for the Swedish government.</p>

The music and original French lyrics had passed into the public domain, but the English version was still under copyright. The government settled the rights <a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/o-canada">for a dollar</a>.</p>



<p>Ironically, the copyright to the English lyrics would have expired anyways by the time the <em>National Anthem Act</em> was finally passed in 1980.</p>

<p>a word, a personal name, a design, a letter, a numeral, a colour, a figurative element, a three-dimensional shape, a hologram, a moving image, a mode of packaging goods, a sound, a scent, a taste, a texture and the positioning of a sign.</p>

<p>I learned about the rule of twelfths from a kayaking instructor and guide, who used it to estimate the tides. In locations and seasons with a&nbsp;<a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/tutorial_tides/tides07_cycles.html">semidiurnal tide pattern</a>, the period of the tide is roughly 12 hours, and the rule of twelfths tells you what the water will be doing in each hour.</p>



<p>For example, if you know that the difference between low and high tide is 3 feet, then you can quickly estimate that it the tide will rise by about 3 inches in the first hour, 6 inches in the second, 9 inches in the third and fourth, 6 inches in the fifth hour, and 3 inches in the last hour before high tide.</p>

<p>Since the &#8217;50s, Alberta has engaged in a deliberate effort to prevent rats from entering the province. Fortunately, rats can&#8217;t survive in the wild in Alberta, so they <a href="https://www.alberta.ca/history-of-rat-control-in-alberta">have pest inspectors regularly check every premise</a> within a 29 x 600 km control zone from Montana to Cold Lake. Pet rats are illegal.</p>



<p>The rat-free status of Alberta led to a Wikipedia edit war over whether the province should appear on <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Brown_rat_distribution.png#filehistory">a map of the brown rat&#8217;s habitat</a>. At some point it was decided to remove the map entirely from the English-language entry for <em>Rattus norvegicus</em>, but its presence on other Wikimedia projects means the edit war still rages on to this day.</p>

<p>Not all 26 letters of the alphabet appear on BC license plates. Six are missing ‚Äî and the reason goes all the way back to 1970, when BC switched from issuing sequential plate numbers to an alphanumeric system.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>One [story] is that&nbsp;the stamps used by employees of the MVB for compiling licensing documents in 1960s only had enough space for ten (10) characters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other is that when the province upgraded the machinery at the Oakalla Plate Shop in the mid-1950s, it was designed to accommodate a maximum row of ten (10) different dies for each of the six columns that might be used in the license plate&#8217;s serial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless of which, if any of these stories is the correct one, the alphabet was broken into two blocks of ten letters with the first block¬†comprising A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, and K with ‚ÄúI‚Äù excluded as it too closely resembled the number one.</p>

<p>The second block of letters used on BC passenger license plates was L, M, N, P, R, S, T, V, W, and X. The letters I and O were obviously <a href="https://xkcd.com/1105/">too similar to 1 and 0</a>, and Q was apparently also skipped due to its resemblance to zero<sup data-fn="321b2142-680d-40d1-8f77-8224d0d60993" class="fn"><a href="#321b2142-680d-40d1-8f77-8224d0d60993" id="321b2142-680d-40d1-8f77-8224d0d60993-link">1</a></sup>. I imagine U was excluded instead of X to minimize the number of unusable plate numbers containing rude words. Y and Z missed out just because they‚Äôre at the end of the alphabet.</p>



<p>BC has issued several different plate series since the ‚Äô70s and the manufacturing process has presumably changed since then, but I believe the letters have remained the same. To this day, I have still never seen an I, O, Q, U, Y, or Z on a BC passenger car.</p>



<p>Keep an eye out for other types of vehicles, though. Motorcycle plates starting with U, Y, and Z were issued in 2012‚Äì14, 2017‚Äì18, and 2019‚Äì20 respectively, and the letters can also be spotted on plates assigned to commercial trucks.</p>


<ol class="wp-block-footnotes"><li id="321b2142-680d-40d1-8f77-8224d0d60993">I recall asking this at the end of my driver&#8217;s test many years ago, and being given this answer by an ICBC employee. This is supported by the fact that other kinds of plates are issued with U, Y, and Z but not the three ambiguous characters. That said, I&#8217;m a little curious why S was not also skipped due to its resemblance to the number 5.  <a href="#321b2142-680d-40d1-8f77-8224d0d60993-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote reference 1"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/21a9.png" alt="‚Ü©" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Ô∏é</a></li></ol>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Baker">Mount Baker</a> was named by George Vancouver after his third lieutenant, who was the first on his ship to see it.</p>



<p>Although the name is better than a few others in the Pacific Northwest, being the first person to see a giant mountain isn&#8217;t a particularly notable claim to fame. Especially when you have to ignore not only tens of thousands of people who lived there but also the Spaniards who had <a href="https://text-message.blogs.archives.gov/2017/10/12/225-years-ago-spanish-explorations-of-the-pacific-northwest-and-the-first-spanish-settlement-in-washington-state-nunez-gaona-neah-bay-1792-part-ii-spanish-explorations-of-the-pacific-northwest-a/">gotten there the year prior</a>.</p>

<p>The mountain appears as <em>la gran monta√±a del Carmelo</em> on <a href="https://doi.org/10.58066/a0dr-8a54">a map</a> drawn by Gonzalo Lopez de Haro, first pilot on Manuel Quimper‚Äôs six-week expedition to the Juan de Fuca strait. The Spanish name is apparently a reference to a religious order whose white cloaks resembled the snow-capped peak. Who knows, if the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootka_Crisis">Nootka Crisis</a> had been resolved differently, it&#8217;s entirely possible that Europeans would have ended up calling it Monte Carmelo.</p>



<p>Instead, the name Mount Baker stuck after Vancouver described it in his published memoir.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>About this time a very high conspicuous craggy mountain ‚Ä¶ presented itself, towering above the clouds: as low down as they allowed it to be visible it was covered with snow; and south of it, was a long ridge of very rugged snowy mountains, much less elevated, which seemed to stretch to a considerable distance ‚Ä¶ the high distant land formed, as already observed, like detached islands, amongst which the lofty mountain, discovered in the afternoon by the third lieutenant, and in compliment to him called by me Mount Baker, rose a very conspicuous object ‚Ä¶ apparently at a very remote distance.</p>

<p>Vancouver&#8217;s diary mentions encounters with different indigenous groups of the area, some friendly and some indifferent,<sup data-fn="0937946a-e2f5-41a5-a34d-1a7e0e7ece3c" class="fn"><a href="#0937946a-e2f5-41a5-a34d-1a7e0e7ece3c" id="0937946a-e2f5-41a5-a34d-1a7e0e7ece3c-link">1</a></sup> but he never stuck around in the same place long enough to learn their names or pick up their languages.<sup data-fn="a1b0c471-c99e-4b0f-96d6-d75194ae94e2" class="fn"><a href="#a1b0c471-c99e-4b0f-96d6-d75194ae94e2" id="a1b0c471-c99e-4b0f-96d6-d75194ae94e2-link">2</a></sup> If he had, he might have recognized Mount Baker by the name <em>kwelshan</em>, <a href="http://arcadianabe.blogspot.com/2012/12/koma-kulshan-mysterious-mountain-moniker.html">the term used</a> by the Lhaq&#8217;temish (Lummi) people around Bellingham and the San Juan Islands, or <em>sw√° îl”ôxÃ£</em>, <a href="https://lingpapers.sites.olt.ubc.ca/#icsnl-xxxii-1997-25">reportedly used</a> by the n…ôx ∑s∆õÃï√°yÃï…ômÃï (Klallam) people on the Olympic Peninsula.</p>



<p>The mountain itself is surrounded by the traditional lands of the Nooksack and Upper Skagit peoples. The Nooksack use <em>kwelsh√°n</em> for the high open slopes of the mountain and <em>kweq‚Äô sm√°nit</em> for the glacier-covered summit.</p>

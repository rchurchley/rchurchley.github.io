<p>Julius Caesar’s given name was Gaius. &#8220;Julius&#8221; and &#8220;Caesar&#8221; were both family names (Caesar being a branch of the Julia family).</p>



<p>In his time, he was referred to as&nbsp;<em>Gaius Caesar</em> or simply as <em>Caesar</em> by <a href="https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Commentarii_de_bello_Gallico">himself</a> and <a href="https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Pro_Marcello">his contemporaries</a>. Calling him &#8220;Julius Caesar&#8221; would have been redundant since every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julii_Caesares">Caesar</a> was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_gens">Julius</a>.</p>



<p>The Romans had a lot of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_naming_conventions">traditions</a>&nbsp;around names.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Julius_Caesar_(name)">Gaius Julius Caesar</a>&nbsp;inherited his name from his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.</p>



<p>Caesar’s great-nephew&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Gaius Octavius Thurinus</a>&nbsp;also took the name Gaius Julius Caesar when he inherited the assassinated dictator’s estate. To prevent confusion, he’s often called&nbsp;<em>Octavianus</em>, which is more or less the ancient Roman equivalent to &#8220;the artist formerly known as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)">Prince</a>&#8220;. The emperor&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula">Caligula</a>, Octavian’s great-grandson, was also named Gaius Caesar; we know him by a nickname he received as a small child.</p>

<p>Between cabbage, lettuce, maple, and holly, two plants are in the rosid clade (related to roses) and two are in the asterid clade (related to sunflowers). Can you guess which is which?</p>



<span id="more-143"></span>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1600" height="900" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/taxonomy-jpg.webp" alt="A two-by-two grid of plant photos. Clockwise from top left: a maple tree, a holly tree, a lettuce plant, and a cabbage plant." class="wp-image-213" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/taxonomy-jpg.webp 1600w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/taxonomy-800x450.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/taxonomy-768x432.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/taxonomy-1536x864.webp 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>I would have guessed that the trees might be related to a woody rose bush, while the leafy greens would be closer to broad-leaved sunflowers. I would have been wrong. Plants are <em>much</em> weirder than that.</p>



<p>In fact, cabbages are much more closely related to maple trees than they are to lettuce;&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica_oleracea">cabbage</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple">maples</a>&nbsp;are both&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosids">rosids</a>. Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly">holly trees</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lettuce">lettuce</a>&nbsp;are both&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterids">asterids</a>.</p>



<p>As it turns out, a lot of the categories we use to think about plants — trees, bushes, berries, vegetables, and so on — are not particularly unique from an genetic perspective. Biologist Georgia Ray&nbsp;<a href="https://eukaryotewritesblog.com/2021/05/02/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-tree/">explains</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>On the evolutionary tree of plants, trees are regularly interspersed with things that are&nbsp;<em>absolutely, 100%</em>&nbsp;not trees. This means that, for instance:</p>



<ul>
<li>The common ancestor of a maple and a mulberry tree was not a tree.</li>



<li>The common ancestor of a stinging nettle and a strawberry plant was a tree.</li>



<li>And this is true for most trees or non-trees that you can think of.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>Because of this, there are plenty of plant lists you can play &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_of_These_Things_(Is_Not_Like_the_Others)">One of these things is not like the others</a>&#8221;&nbsp;with where the intuitive answer is very different from the phylogenetic answer.</p>

<p>Every new emoji starts with a formal proposal justifying why it should exist. The proposal for <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1faf5.png" alt="🫵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> starts with four pages of the history of people pointing at the viewer in art.</p>



<span id="more-141"></span>



<p>Only a few emoji are accepted every year, but anyone can submit suggestions for new emoji. For example:</p>



<ul>
<li><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1fabc.png" alt="🪼" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2021/21217-jellyfish-emoji.pdf">proposed</a>&nbsp;by marine biologists.</li>



<li><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1fa97.png" alt="🪗" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2019/19087-accordion-emoji.pdf">proposed</a>&nbsp;by accordion historian&nbsp;<a href="https://accordionuprising.wordpress.com/about/">Bruce Triggs</a></li>



<li><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1fad8.png" alt="🫘" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> was <a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2020/20226-beans-emoji.pdf">proposed</a> by someone who just enjoys &#8220;chowing down on the occasional bowl of baked beans.&#8221;</li>
</ul>



<p>To address the Unicode Consortium’s&nbsp;<a href="https://unicode.org/emoji/proposals.html">emoji selection criteria</a>, you’ll find proposals arguing things like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2016/16304-fantasy-creatures.pdf">mermaids are 522% more popular than goblins</a>&nbsp;or that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2019/19103-teapot-emoji.pdf">teapots are not too similar to teacups</a>. Older emoji didn’t go through the same kind of selection process, which is presumably why there are three separate emoji for optical computer media: <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4c0.png" alt="📀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4bf.png" alt="💿" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4bd.png" alt="💽" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />.</p>



<p>You can find most emoji proposals linked from their&nbsp;<a href="https://emojipedia.org/">Emojipedia</a>&nbsp;page. Here are a few interesting or funny submissions I’ve seen. (All quotations&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sixthcircuitappellateblog.com/uncategorized/a-brief-history-and-status-of-cleaned-up-in-the-sixth-circuit/#page=1">cleaned up</a>.)</p>

<p>Since then, several yo-yo booms have swept the world, often on 7 year cycles of boom and bust. Some may say that the yo-yo has its ups and downs.</p>

<p>Books about dinosaurs range from nonfiction descriptions of the now-extinct animals, to fictional thrillers, like Michael Crichton’s Jurassic Park, to the 488 (!!) books identified as &#8220;Dinosaur Erotica&#8221; in Amazon’s Kindle store.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em><a href="https://archive.org/details/CRCHandbookOfChemistryAndPhysics97thEdition2016">CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics</a></em>&nbsp;is a 2600-page tome of random facts and figures, from the speed of sound in various media to the chemical composition of the human body.</p>



<p>My sixth-grade teacher’s copy was one of the most fascinating objects of my childhood, and it still makes me giggle with delight.</p>



<span id="more-136"></span>

<p>This picture illustrates the danger of poorly-designed streets, which the Swedish government set out to improve in the 1990s. It was originally created by Swedish artist <a href="http://www.jilg.com/">Karl Jilg</a>, who was commissioned by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Road_Administration">Swedish Road Administration</a> to explain new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_Zero">Vision Zero</a> initiatives.</p>



<span id="more-132"></span>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-23176-7_8-1">ideas</a>&nbsp;behind the initiatives were that</p>



<ol>
<li>The responsibility for preventing deaths and injuries on the road transportation system partly rests with the people who design that infrastructure, and</li>



<li>Deaths and injuries on the road ultimately come down to kinetic energy.</li>
</ol>



<p>The picture is intended to turn the kinetic energy of a moving car into a height to show the consequences of simple human mistakes in the road system. Research shows that the highest acceptable speed on a street with active users like this is 30km/h.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="800" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jilg-sidewalk-jpeg.webp" alt="An illustration of a city block with bottomless pits for streets." class="wp-image-227" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jilg-sidewalk-jpeg.webp 600w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jilg-sidewalk-450x600.webp 450w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Pedestrians navigate the dangerous chasms of city streets. (Karl Jilg / Vägverket)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The image has been widely shared, thanks in part to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/11/18/7236471/cars-pedestrians-sidewalks-roads">a 2014 Vox article</a>&nbsp;that used it to call attention to other pedestrian-hostile aspects about many cities’ street designs:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Most roads in the US are built for cars, not for pedestrians. This brilliant illustration shows just how lopsided the the proportions of a normal urban street corner really are.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The city sidewalk picture is just one of a series of four that Jilg illustrated for the Swedish government. The other one I found is set on a highway.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="800" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jilg-canyon-jpeg.webp" alt="An illustration of a car speeding along a road high in the mountains." class="wp-image-228" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jilg-canyon-jpeg.webp 600w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jilg-canyon-450x600.webp 450w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A car moving at highway speeds has a lot of kinetic energy. (Karl Jilg / Vägverket)</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’m not sure whether Jilg did any calculations to create these, but a head-on collision between two cars at highway speed is approximately equivalent to a single car being dropped from a height of 200m. Sweden added median barriers to many highways in the late ’90s, which reduced the incidence of head-on collisions and the risk of fatalities by 80%.</p>



<p>I have unfortunately not been able to find the other two illustrations in the set. Jilg has, however, done other work for the Swedish government.</p>

<p>You can get a really good approximation of a sinusoidal curve from twelve equally-spaced line segments of slope 1/12, 2/12, 3/12, 3/12, 2/12, 1/12, -1/12, -2/12, -3/12, -3/12, -2/12, and -1/12, respectively.</p>



<p>This approximation, known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_twelfths">rule of twelfths</a>, rounds √3≈5/3​ but otherwise uses exact values along the curve.</p>



<p>I learned about the rule of twelfths from a kayaking instructor and guide, who used it to estimate the tides. In locations and seasons with a&nbsp;<a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/tutorial_tides/tides07_cycles.html">semidiurnal tide pattern</a>, the period of the tide is roughly 12 hours, and the rule of twelfths tells you what the water will be doing in each hour.</p>



<p>For example, if you know that the difference between low and high tide is 3 feet, then you can quickly estimate that it the tide will rise by about 3 inches in the first hour, 6 inches in the second, 9 inches in the third and fourth, 6 inches in the fifth hour, and 3 inches in the last hour before high tide.</p>

<p>The time it takes to properly roast a whole turkey is proportional to its weight to the ⅔ power. My old&nbsp;<a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/stml-27">mathematical modelling textbook</a>&nbsp;specifically recommends&nbsp;45 minutes per lb<sup>2/3</sup>&nbsp;when cooked at 350℉.</p>



<p>For a spherical turkey of uniform thermal conductivity <em>α</em> and density <em>ρ</em>, a precise formula <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/adv/article/11/11/115316/992343/Physics-in-turkey-cooking-Revisit-the-Panofsky">has been derived</a>:</p>

<p>where the oven is set at&nbsp;T<sub>h</sub> and the center of the turkey needs to reach a temperature of&nbsp;T<sub>f</sub> from&nbsp;T<sub>0</sub>.</p>



<p>The more general ⅔ power law does not depend on unrealistic assumptions about the turkey’s shape or thermodynamic properties; it can be derived from pure&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis">dimensional analysis</a>&nbsp;and applied to turkey-shaped meat-based objects by fitting a curve to specific cook times used by chefs.</p>

<p>One [story] is that&nbsp;the stamps used by employees of the MVB for compiling licensing documents in 1960s only had enough space for ten (10) characters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other is that when the province upgraded the machinery at the Oakalla Plate Shop in the mid-1950s, it was designed to accommodate a maximum row of ten (10) different dies for each of the six columns that might be used in the license plate&#8217;s serial.&nbsp;</p>

<span id="more-79"></span>



<p>The second block of letters used on BC passenger license plates was L, M, N, P, R, S, T, V, W, and X. The letters I and O were obviously <a href="https://xkcd.com/1105/">too similar to 1 and 0</a>, and Q was apparently also skipped due to its resemblance to zero<sup data-fn="321b2142-680d-40d1-8f77-8224d0d60993" class="fn"><a href="#321b2142-680d-40d1-8f77-8224d0d60993" id="321b2142-680d-40d1-8f77-8224d0d60993-link">1</a></sup>. I imagine U was excluded instead of X to minimize the number of unusable plate numbers containing rude words. Y and Z missed out just because they’re at the end of the alphabet.</p>



<p>BC has issued several different plate series since the ’70s and the manufacturing process has presumably changed since then, but I believe the letters have remained the same. To this day, I have still never seen an I, O, Q, U, Y, or Z on a BC passenger car.</p>



<p>Keep an eye out for other types of vehicles, though. Motorcycle plates starting with U, Y, and Z were issued in 2012–14, 2017–18, and 2019–20 respectively, and the letters can also be spotted on plates assigned to commercial trucks.</p>


<ol class="wp-block-footnotes"><li id="321b2142-680d-40d1-8f77-8224d0d60993">I recall asking this at the end of my driver&#8217;s test many years ago, and being given this answer by an ICBC employee. This is supported by the fact that other kinds of plates are issued with U, Y, and Z but not the three ambiguous characters. That said, I&#8217;m a little curious why S was not also skipped due to its resemblance to the number 5.  <a href="#321b2142-680d-40d1-8f77-8224d0d60993-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote reference 1"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />︎</a></li></ol>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I love the dry humour in cricket commentary. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/wanderers-scrambles-to-find-plan-bee-1080873">This episode</a> describes what happened when bees swarmed the pitch in South Africa’s third ODI against Sri Lanka.</p>

<p>At first they deployed a man with a stick. The groundsman approached one buzzing batch, decided his mode of attack would not work, and returned defeated.</p>



<p>Eventually a professional was summoned. One man lived out what must be the dreams of many aspiring beekeepers in South Africa, when he walked to the middle of a packed Wanderers stadium in his trademark baggy whites, nervelessly placed down his plastic box full of honeycomb, and masterfully opened up the lid. Before long he had ensnared his quarry, probably to wild cheers and fans offering to give him their numbers.</p>



<p>All up, the bees had spent about 65 minutes in the middle, which many noted, was more time than some Sri Lanka batsmen had managed.</p>

<p>We start from [a set of random] polygons that are invisible. In each optimization step we randomly modify one parameter (like color components or polygon vertices) and check whether such new variant looks more like the original image. If it is, we keep it, and continue to mutate this one instead</p>

<p>Just feed it an image and hit start, and a random collection of coloured polygons will gradually evolve into a cool abstract rendition of your picture.</p>

<p><strong>Do I have to kill the snake?</strong></p>



<p>University guidelines state that you have to “defeat” the snake. There are many ways to accomplish this. Lots of students choose to wrestle the snake. Some construct decoys and elaborate traps to confuse and then ensnare the snake. One student brought a flute and played a song to lull the snake to sleep. Then he threw the snake out a window.</p>



<p><strong>Are the snakes big?</strong></p>



<p>We have lots of different snakes. The quality of your work determines which snake you will fight. The better your thesis is, the smaller the snake will be.</p>

<p>I recently attended a Seattle Mariners game as part of a Microsoft event. It was my first time at a baseball game, so I recorded a bunch of observations about the experience.</p>



<span id="more-457"></span>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The stadium experience</h2>



<p>This was my first time attending any professional sport in person, so I didn&#8217;t have any idea what to expect. I checked the <a href="https://www.mlb.com/mariners/ballpark/information/guide">stadium rules</a> in advance and found I could bring my camera, but not my camera bag or any of my larger lenses. Fortunately, my wide-angle lens and 20–55mm kit lens — both barely within the regulations — were enough to get some interesting photos.</p>



<p>A big part of the ballpark experience is being able to wander around the stadium; I spent at least half the game exploring rather than sitting in my assigned seat. There&#8217;s a lot to look at and do in the stadium, and as long as you&#8217;re not blocking anyone&#8217;s view during an at-bat, there&#8217;s remarkable freedom to walk around the aisles and see the field from different angles.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Baseball is complicated</h2>



<p>Many of the Microsoft employees at the game — including myself — are more familiar with cricket than with baseball. Cricket has a reputation in North America for being hard to understand, but when I compare my <a href="https://rosschurchley.com/blog/2024/cricket-in-600-words-or-less/">beginner&#8217;s guide to cricket</a> with our deliberations our section had to understand what was going on, I realized that baseball is <em>much</em> more complicated.</p>

<details class="wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow"><summary>Can you decipher these scoreboards?</summary>
<p>The bottom of the screen is the easiest to understand. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_zone">Balls, strikes</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)">outs</a> are fundamental to the game and relatively easy to explain to a newcomer<sup data-fn="d2bd537f-6e0d-41e2-aeaa-ec28deb4b285" class="fn"><a href="#d2bd537f-6e0d-41e2-aeaa-ec28deb4b285" id="d2bd537f-6e0d-41e2-aeaa-ec28deb4b285-link">1</a></sup>. Each team&#8217;s current score is the total number of runs under the &#8220;R&#8221; column; columns 1–9 show how many runs were scored in each inning. The &#8220;H&#8221; column counts the number of hits resulting on a runner on base due to the batting team&#8217;s efforts; the &#8220;E&#8221; column counts the number of errors by the fielding team that allowed their opponent to get a runner on base. I had no idea what the acronym &#8220;MVR&#8221; stood for until a colleague expanded it to &#8220;mound visits remaining&#8221;; this refers to a kind of time out the fielding team can take to discuss strategy or switch pitchers.</p>



<p>The sides of the scoreboard display the current lineup of each team with jersey numbers and positions; the highlighted name tells you whose turn it is to bat. The batting lineup shows one other piece of information for each player:</p>



<ul>
<li>For players that have not yet batted in the inning, it shows the batting average.</li>



<li>For players that have batted already in the inning, it shows a <a href="https://www.mlb.com/glossary/miscellaneous/scorekeeping">cryptic acronym</a> that tells you the result of their at-bat.</li>



<li>For pitchers (who do not bat), I think it shows the pitcher&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average">earned runs average</a> (ERA) which is its own whole thing.</li>
</ul>



<p>On this scoreboard, we see that Seattle&#8217;s Dominic Canzone, who wears number 8 on his jersey, plays left field and is currently up to bat. His batting average is .219.</p>



<p>Three Seattle players have already batted this inning. Center fielder Raleigh had a single (1B), as did right fielder Raley. First baseman France is listed as having a &#8220;P3&#8221; which is apparently the acronym for &#8220;out after hitting a pop fly which was caught by the first baseman.&#8221;</p>



<p>Finally, the middle of the first scoreboard shows the statistics of the current batter. I had to look up most of the stats <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_statistics">on Wikipedia</a>:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th>Abbr</th><th>Value</th><th>Stat</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>G</td><td>15</td><td>Games</td><td>Number of games the batter has played in this year.</td></tr><tr><td>AB</td><td>32</td><td>At-bats</td><td>Number of opportunities the batter had to bat, more or less, except that walks and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat">some other outcomes</a> don&#8217;t count towards this statistic.</td></tr><tr><td>2B</td><td>1</td><td>Doubles</td><td>Number of hits on which the batter was able to safely reach second base.</td></tr><tr><td>3B</td><td>0</td><td>Triples</td><td>Number of hits on which the batter was able to safely reach third base.</td></tr><tr><td>BB</td><td>3</td><td>Bases on balls</td><td>Number of times the batter was awarded first base after four called balls. (Better known as &#8220;walks&#8221;.)</td></tr><tr><td>SO</td><td>11</td><td>Strikeouts</td><td>Number of times the batter was called out after three strikes.</td></tr><tr><td>SB</td><td>0</td><td>Stolen bases</td><td>Number of times the player was able to steal a base. There are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base">bunch of rules</a> about when a runner can steal a base and when something is scored under this statistic.</td></tr><tr><td>CS</td><td>0</td><td>Caught stealing</td><td>Number of times the player was tagged out while attempting to steal a base.</td></tr><tr><td>AVG</td><td>.219</td><td>Batting average</td><td>Percentage of at-bats where the batter hit the ball and safely reached a base.</td></tr><tr><td>R</td><td>4</td><td>Runs</td><td>Number of times the batter scored a run by crossing home plate.</td></tr><tr><td>H</td><td>7</td><td>Hits</td><td>Number of times the batter hit the ball and safely reached a base.</td></tr><tr><td>HR</td><td>3</td><td>Home runs</td><td>Number of hits on which the batter was able to safely touch all three bases and cross home plate. (Usually by hitting the ball into the crowd.)</td></tr><tr><td>RBI</td><td>6</td><td>Runs batted in</td><td>Number of times the batter&#8217;s action allowed another player to score a run.</td></tr><tr><td>OBP</td><td>.286</td><td>On-base percentage</td><td>Percentage of the time the batter gets on base, including being awarded first base for a walk or being hit by a pitch.</td></tr><tr><td>SLG</td><td>.531</td><td>Slugging percentage</td><td>Average number of bases achieved per at-bat.</td></tr><tr><td>OPS</td><td>.817</td><td>On-base plus slugging</td><td>OBP plus SLG, for some reason.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Phew, we finally understand the scoreboard on the left! Now we just need to figure out what &#8220;FC, E5, No RBI&#8221; is supposed to mean. This was displayed on the jumbotron after the following play:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://sporty-clips.mlb.com/V3k0RDlfWGw0TUFRPT1fVndFQUJnSUVYMWNBRFFZQlhnQUFVQWRTQUZrSFYxQUFBbDBFQmxKVFVsQUVBUXBY.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>&#8220;FC&#8221; stands for &#8220;fielder&#8217;s choice&#8221;, meaning that the third baseman chose to try to get the out at third instead of throwing it to first. This means the hit doesn&#8217;t count towards the batter&#8217;s statistics. The &#8220;E5&#8221; means the scorer decided that the Seattle players were safe because of the third baseman&#8217;s error. Finally, the run that scored during the play does not count as an RBI for the batter because if it weren&#8217;t for the error, there would have been three outs and the runner wouldn&#8217;t have scored.</p>



<p>All of this is to say: baseball is <em>complicated</em>.</p>
</details>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Spot the camera</h2>



<p>Before I came to the game I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLU9C9rstIA">a video</a> about camera assignments at professional baseball games and I had fun finding the camera operators at high first, low first, and center field. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1280" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0078-1920x1280.webp" alt="Two camera operators stand on a fenced-in platform above the center-field wall and point their cameras at the pitcher and batter." class="wp-image-460" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0078-1920x1280.webp 1920w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0078-800x533.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0078-768x512.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0078-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0078-2048x1365.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The camera operators at center field are responsible for filming each pitch.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I was walking around the concourse when the Mariners&#8217; Ty France <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/sporty-videos?playId=1f0dcd65-76bb-4a00-80fe-4e920e376a91">hit a home run</a>. While the crowed erupted in cheers, I was excited for a different reason — I was in the perfect position to watch the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable-suspended_camera_system">cable-suspended camera</a> move into position behind third base and film the runner crossing home plate!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1080" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0098-1920x1080.webp" alt="A mobile camera hanging from a pair of cables follows a Seattle Mariners baseball player jogging towards third base." class="wp-image-461" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0098-1920x1080.webp 1920w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0098-800x450.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0098-768x432.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0098-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0098-2048x1152.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The cable operated camera follows the batter along the third base line after a home run.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Random people keep the ball rolling</h2>



<p>To me, no sport is as compelling as all the logistics and anonymous work that goes on behind the scenes. For example, T-Mobile Park still has an analog scoreboard in addition to all the digital ones, which means someone has to be in charge of updating it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1280" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0091-1920x1280.webp" alt="A young, bored-looking person sits on a chair and rests their arms on the stadium scoreboard." class="wp-image-468" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0091-1920x1280.webp 1920w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0091-800x533.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0091-768x512.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0091-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0091-2048x1365.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<p>Every time a player gets on base, their team&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batboy">batboy</a> runs out to pick up their discarded bat and help switch their gloves. The home team&#8217;s batboy is also responsible for refilling the umpire&#8217;s stock of extra balls, which happens a lot — MLB teams go through <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/3325753/2022/05/26/guardians-tigers-baseballs-used/">about a hundred balls</a> in a game!</p>

<p>The most exciting piece of logistics came between innings, when an army of men with rakes came out to smooth the base paths.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Take me out to the ball game?</h2>



<p>I&#8217;m never going to be a person who regularly attends live sports: it&#8217;s too crowded, too noisy, and I don&#8217;t care enough about the action happening on the field. But I&#8217;m really glad to have gone once. It was a lot of fun to explore the stadium and see a few glimpses of what goes in to putting on a baseball game. Thanks Microsoft for bringing me to a fun event! </p>

<ol class="wp-block-footnotes"><li id="d2bd537f-6e0d-41e2-aeaa-ec28deb4b285">Although even that explanation is not straightforward. &#8220;A strike is when the ball passes over the plate between the batter&#8217;s knees and shoulders and the batter doesn&#8217;t hit it; or if the batter swings and misses, regardless of where the ball is; or if the batter hits the ball behind the foul lines, except a foul ball doesn&#8217;t count for strike three.&#8221; <a href="#d2bd537f-6e0d-41e2-aeaa-ec28deb4b285-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote reference 1"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />︎</a></li></ol>]]></content:encoded>

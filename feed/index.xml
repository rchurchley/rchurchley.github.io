<p>Cricket has a bit of a reputation for being hard to understand, but it&#8217;s actually a simpler game than the most popular North American sports.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s everything you need to know to enjoy a cricket match in 600 words or less.</p>



<span id="more-482"></span>



<p>Cricket is played on an oval field with a rectangular pitch in the middle. Two players on the batting team stand on either side of the pitch; the eleven players on the fielding team take up positions around the field.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1600" height="713" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/oval-jpg.webp" alt="A wide angle of a cricket match in progress." class="wp-image-487" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/oval-jpg.webp 1600w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/oval-800x357.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/oval-768x342.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/oval-1536x684.webp 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This wide angle shows nine of the England fielders in red (two are out of frame to the right), two New Zealand batters in black, and two umpires.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Runs</h2>



<p>The cricket ball is bowled overarm by a player on the fielding team and can bounce once. The batter hits the ball and switches ends with the other batter, scoring one run each time this happens.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Delivery.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A typical delivery is bowled and hit for a single run. The batter can choose not to run if they don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll make it in time.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If the batter hits the ball all the way to the boundary of the field, they score four runs automatically.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Boundary-Four.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>If they hit the ball really hard over the boundary, they score six runs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Boundary-Six.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A ball hit into the stands is worth six runs — but the crowd has to give it back so the same ball can be used for the whole innings.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wickets</h2>



<p>The goal of the fielding team is to get the batters out (&#8220;take their wickets&#8221;) before they score lots of runs.</p>



<p>The batter is <strong>out caught</strong> if they hit the ball and a fielder catches it before it hits the ground.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wicket-Caught.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Out caught is the most common form of dismissal in cricket.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The batter is <strong>out bowled</strong> if they miss and the ball hits the wicket behind them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wicket-Bowled.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Some games have fancy stumps and bails that light up when the wicket is broken.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The batter is <strong>out leg before wicket</strong> if they use their body to block the ball from hitting the wicket.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wicket-LBW.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A batter is out LBW if the ball hits their body and would have gone on to hit the wicket.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The batter is <strong>run out</strong> if they run and the fielding side breaks the wicket before they&#8217;re safe.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wicket-Run-out.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">To be safe, the batter&#8217;s body or bat must be touching the ground behind the white line.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The batter is <strong>out stumped</strong> if they come too far out, miss the ball, and get run out by the wicketkeeper.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wicket-Stumped.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The wicketkeeper stumps the batter by breaking the wicket with the ball or their hand holding the ball.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overs</h2>



<p>Every six balls<sup data-fn="99fed2f4-c6f7-45ae-9262-1e7a4f82165b" class="fn"><a href="#99fed2f4-c6f7-45ae-9262-1e7a4f82165b" id="99fed2f4-c6f7-45ae-9262-1e7a4f82165b-link">1</a></sup>, the fielders switch ends and a different player from the fielding team comes on to bowl. Six balls is also called an <strong>over</strong>.</p>



<p>Each team gets to bat for 20 overs<sup data-fn="99ce75d3-e31e-4847-9632-c32296b65a09" class="fn"><a href="#99ce75d3-e31e-4847-9632-c32296b65a09" id="99ce75d3-e31e-4847-9632-c32296b65a09-link">2</a></sup> or until they have lost ten wickets. Whichever team has the most runs after both sides bat wins.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Extras</h2>



<p>There are a bunch of rules that govern how the ball should be bowled. A violation results in a do-over, except the batting team is awarded an extra run and gets to keep any runs they scored off the illegal delivery.</p>



<p>A <strong>wide</strong> is signalled if the umpire judges that the ball was bowled too wide or too high for it to be reasonably hit.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Extra-Wide.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The umpire signals a wide by stretching their arms out.</figcaption></figure>



<p>A <strong>no ball</strong> is signalled if the bowler steps too far over the white line while bowling.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/No-ball.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Overstepping is the most common way a no ball is called against a bowler.</figcaption></figure>



<p>A no ball also turns the next ball into a &#8220;free hit&#8221;, meaning the batter is immune from getting out caught, bowled, stumped, or LBW off that ball.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Positions</h2>



<p>A typical team roster has some specialist <strong>batters</strong> who usually don&#8217;t bowl, some specialist <strong>bowlers</strong> who aren&#8217;t expected to get lots of runs, and some <strong>all-rounders</strong> who are good at both batting and bowling.</p>



<p>There are two main bowling styles: <strong>fast bowlers</strong> rely on the speed of their deliveries while <strong>spin bowlers</strong> deliver slow but tricky balls.</p>



<p>Each team has a <strong>wicketkeeper</strong> who stops the balls that get past the batter. You can recognize the wicketkeeper as the only fielder who wears gloves.</p>



<p>Fielders can be deployed anywhere, subject to a few restrictions.<sup data-fn="1d6b6fa8-d61b-403f-b70b-2587dd8c9711" class="fn"><a href="#1d6b6fa8-d61b-403f-b70b-2587dd8c9711" id="1d6b6fa8-d61b-403f-b70b-2587dd8c9711-link">3</a></sup> Commentators describe fielding positions using funny names like slip, gully, mid-off, square leg, and third man. You don&#8217;t need to memorize these.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Scoreboard</h2>



<p>A typical TV broadcast overlay displays the following information:</p>



<ul>
<li>The batting team&#8217;s current run total and wickets lost.<sup data-fn="c2ccf6cd-bb84-4278-a55f-12365bf3377f" class="fn"><a href="#c2ccf6cd-bb84-4278-a55f-12365bf3377f" id="c2ccf6cd-bb84-4278-a55f-12365bf3377f-link">4</a></sup></li>



<li>The number of overs completed or the number of balls remaining.</li>



<li>The<strong> </strong>current batters&#8217; names, runs scored, and balls faced, with some indication of which batter is facing the next ball.</li>



<li>The current bowler.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1600" height="900" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/scoreline-jpg.webp" alt="A cricket TV broadcast. The overlay reads as follows: ENG 101-2. 12/20. Run Rate 8.42. Beaumont 47* (39), Jones 23 (10). NZ Kasperek 1-24 (2)." class="wp-image-492" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/scoreline-jpg.webp 1600w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/scoreline-800x450.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/scoreline-768x432.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/scoreline-1536x864.webp 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This overlay indicates that England are batting and have scored 101 runs for the loss of 2 wickets. It is the 12th over in a 20-over match. Beaumont has scored 47 runs off 39 balls and is facing the current ball. Jones has scored 23 runs off 10 balls. The current bowler is New Zealand&#8217;s Kasperek, who has taken 1 wicket and given up 24 runs in 2 overs this match.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When the first team is batting, the overlay may show the current <strong>run rate</strong> (average runs per over).</p>



<p>When the second team is batting, the overlay shows either the <strong>target score</strong> needed to win, or the remaining runs needed to reach the target.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>That&#8217;s all you need to follow and enjoy a cricket match! All that&#8217;s left to learn is a few bits of jargon, the names of the players, and the details of whatever tournament or competition you want to follow. You&#8217;ll pick up all of those as you go.</p>



<p>Some tournaments worth following are:</p>



<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup">Men&#8217;s Twenty20 World Cup</a> (this June).</li>



<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Women%27s_T20_World_Cup">Women&#8217;s Twenty20 World Cup</a> (this October). </li>



<li>England&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehundred.com/">The Hundred</a> (August).</li>

<li>India&#8217;s <a href="https://www.iplt20.com/">IPL</a> (April–May) and <a href="https://www.wplt20.com/">WPL</a> (March).</li>
</ul>



<p>National sides often play <a href="https://www.icc-cricket.com/fixtures-results">series against each other</a> as well.</p>



<p>If you want to watch cricket, most series are carried in Canada by subscription streaming service <a href="https://www.willow.tv/">Willow TV</a>. You can also follow live text summaries and scorecards on sites like <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/">ESPN Cricinfo</a>.</p>

<p>I recently attended a Seattle Mariners game as part of a Microsoft event. It was my first time at a baseball game, so I recorded a bunch of observations about the experience.</p>



<span id="more-457"></span>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The stadium experience</h2>



<p>This was my first time attending any professional sport in person, so I didn&#8217;t have any idea what to expect. I checked the <a href="https://www.mlb.com/mariners/ballpark/information/guide">stadium rules</a> in advance and found I could bring my camera, but not my camera bag or any of my larger lenses. Fortunately, my wide-angle lens and 20–55mm kit lens — both barely within the regulations — were enough to get some interesting photos.</p>



<p>A big part of the ballpark experience is being able to wander around the stadium; I spent at least half the game exploring rather than sitting in my assigned seat. There&#8217;s a lot to look at and do in the stadium, and as long as you&#8217;re not blocking anyone&#8217;s view during an at-bat, there&#8217;s remarkable freedom to walk around the aisles and see the field from different angles.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Baseball is complicated</h2>



<p>Many of the Microsoft employees at the game — including myself — are more familiar with cricket than with baseball. Cricket has a reputation in North America for being hard to understand, but when I compare my <a href="https://rosschurchley.com/blog/2024/cricket-in-600-words-or-less/">beginner&#8217;s guide to cricket</a> with our deliberations our section had to understand what was going on, I realized that baseball is <em>much</em> more complicated.</p>

<details class="wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow"><summary>Can you decipher these scoreboards?</summary>
<p>The bottom of the screen is the easiest to understand. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_zone">Balls, strikes</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)">outs</a> are fundamental to the game and relatively easy to explain to a newcomer<sup data-fn="d2bd537f-6e0d-41e2-aeaa-ec28deb4b285" class="fn"><a href="#d2bd537f-6e0d-41e2-aeaa-ec28deb4b285" id="d2bd537f-6e0d-41e2-aeaa-ec28deb4b285-link">1</a></sup>. Each team&#8217;s current score is the total number of runs under the &#8220;R&#8221; column; columns 1–9 show how many runs were scored in each inning. The &#8220;H&#8221; column counts the number of hits resulting on a runner on base due to the batting team&#8217;s efforts; the &#8220;E&#8221; column counts the number of errors by the fielding team that allowed their opponent to get a runner on base. I had no idea what the acronym &#8220;MVR&#8221; stood for until a colleague expanded it to &#8220;mound visits remaining&#8221;; this refers to a kind of time out the fielding team can take to discuss strategy or switch pitchers.</p>



<p>The sides of the scoreboard display the current lineup of each team with jersey numbers and positions; the highlighted name tells you whose turn it is to bat. The batting lineup shows one other piece of information for each player:</p>



<ul>
<li>For players that have not yet batted in the inning, it shows the batting average.</li>



<li>For players that have batted already in the inning, it shows a <a href="https://www.mlb.com/glossary/miscellaneous/scorekeeping">cryptic acronym</a> that tells you the result of their at-bat.</li>



<li>For pitchers (who do not bat), I think it shows the pitcher&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average">earned runs average</a> (ERA) which is its own whole thing.</li>
</ul>



<p>On this scoreboard, we see that Seattle&#8217;s Dominic Canzone, who wears number 8 on his jersey, plays left field and is currently up to bat. His batting average is .219.</p>



<p>Three Seattle players have already batted this inning. Center fielder Raleigh had a single (1B), as did right fielder Raley. First baseman France is listed as having a &#8220;P3&#8221; which is apparently the acronym for &#8220;out after hitting a pop fly which was caught by the first baseman.&#8221;</p>



<p>Finally, the middle of the first scoreboard shows the statistics of the current batter. I had to look up most of the stats <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_statistics">on Wikipedia</a>:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th>Abbr</th><th>Value</th><th>Stat</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>G</td><td>15</td><td>Games</td><td>Number of games the batter has played in this year.</td></tr><tr><td>AB</td><td>32</td><td>At-bats</td><td>Number of opportunities the batter had to bat, more or less, except that walks and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat">some other outcomes</a> don&#8217;t count towards this statistic.</td></tr><tr><td>2B</td><td>1</td><td>Doubles</td><td>Number of hits on which the batter was able to safely reach second base.</td></tr><tr><td>3B</td><td>0</td><td>Triples</td><td>Number of hits on which the batter was able to safely reach third base.</td></tr><tr><td>BB</td><td>3</td><td>Bases on balls</td><td>Number of times the batter was awarded first base after four called balls. (Better known as &#8220;walks&#8221;.)</td></tr><tr><td>SO</td><td>11</td><td>Strikeouts</td><td>Number of times the batter was called out after three strikes.</td></tr><tr><td>SB</td><td>0</td><td>Stolen bases</td><td>Number of times the player was able to steal a base. There are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base">bunch of rules</a> about when a runner can steal a base and when something is scored under this statistic.</td></tr><tr><td>CS</td><td>0</td><td>Caught stealing</td><td>Number of times the player was tagged out while attempting to steal a base.</td></tr><tr><td>AVG</td><td>.219</td><td>Batting average</td><td>Percentage of at-bats where the batter hit the ball and safely reached a base.</td></tr><tr><td>R</td><td>4</td><td>Runs</td><td>Number of times the batter scored a run by crossing home plate.</td></tr><tr><td>H</td><td>7</td><td>Hits</td><td>Number of times the batter hit the ball and safely reached a base.</td></tr><tr><td>HR</td><td>3</td><td>Home runs</td><td>Number of hits on which the batter was able to safely touch all three bases and cross home plate. (Usually by hitting the ball into the crowd.)</td></tr><tr><td>RBI</td><td>6</td><td>Runs batted in</td><td>Number of times the batter&#8217;s action allowed another player to score a run.</td></tr><tr><td>OBP</td><td>.286</td><td>On-base percentage</td><td>Percentage of the time the batter gets on base, including being awarded first base for a walk or being hit by a pitch.</td></tr><tr><td>SLG</td><td>.531</td><td>Slugging percentage</td><td>Average number of bases achieved per at-bat.</td></tr><tr><td>OPS</td><td>.817</td><td>On-base plus slugging</td><td>OBP plus SLG, for some reason.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Phew, we finally understand the scoreboard on the left! Now we just need to figure out what &#8220;FC, E5, No RBI&#8221; is supposed to mean. This was displayed on the jumbotron after the following play:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://sporty-clips.mlb.com/V3k0RDlfWGw0TUFRPT1fVndFQUJnSUVYMWNBRFFZQlhnQUFVQWRTQUZrSFYxQUFBbDBFQmxKVFVsQUVBUXBY.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>&#8220;FC&#8221; stands for &#8220;fielder&#8217;s choice&#8221;, meaning that the third baseman chose to try to get the out at third instead of throwing it to first. This means the hit doesn&#8217;t count towards the batter&#8217;s statistics. The &#8220;E5&#8221; means the scorer decided that the Seattle players were safe because of the third baseman&#8217;s error. Finally, the run that scored during the play does not count as an RBI for the batter because if it weren&#8217;t for the error, there would have been three outs and the runner wouldn&#8217;t have scored.</p>



<p>All of this is to say: baseball is <em>complicated</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Spot the camera</h2>



<p>Before I came to the game I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLU9C9rstIA">a video</a> about camera assignments at professional baseball games and I had fun finding the camera operators at high first, low first, and center field. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1280" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0078-1920x1280.webp" alt="Two camera operators stand on a fenced-in platform above the center-field wall and point their cameras at the pitcher and batter." class="wp-image-460" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0078-1920x1280.webp 1920w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0078-800x533.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0078-768x512.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0078-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0078-2048x1365.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The camera operators at center field are responsible for filming each pitch.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I was walking around the concourse when the Mariners&#8217; Ty France <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/sporty-videos?playId=1f0dcd65-76bb-4a00-80fe-4e920e376a91">hit a home run</a>. While the crowed erupted in cheers, I was excited for a different reason — I was in the perfect position to watch the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable-suspended_camera_system">cable-suspended camera</a> move into position behind third base and film the runner crossing home plate!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1080" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0098-1920x1080.webp" alt="A mobile camera hanging from a pair of cables follows a Seattle Mariners baseball player jogging towards third base." class="wp-image-461" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0098-1920x1080.webp 1920w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0098-800x450.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0098-768x432.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0098-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0098-2048x1152.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The cable operated camera follows the batter along the third base line after a home run.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Random people keep the ball rolling</h2>



<p>To me, no sport is as compelling as all the logistics and anonymous work that goes on behind the scenes. For example, T-Mobile Park still has an analog scoreboard in addition to all the digital ones, which means someone has to be in charge of updating it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1280" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0091-1920x1280.webp" alt="A young, bored-looking person sits on a chair and rests their arms on the stadium scoreboard." class="wp-image-468" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0091-1920x1280.webp 1920w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0091-800x533.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0091-768x512.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0091-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0091-2048x1365.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<p>Every time a player gets on base, their team&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batboy">batboy</a> runs out to pick up their discarded bat and help switch their gloves. The home team&#8217;s batboy is also responsible for refilling the umpire&#8217;s stock of extra balls, which happens a lot — MLB teams go through <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/3325753/2022/05/26/guardians-tigers-baseballs-used/">about a hundred balls</a> in a game!</p>

<p>The most exciting piece of logistics came between innings, when an army of men with rakes came out to smooth the base paths.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Take me out to the ball game?</h2>



<p>I&#8217;m never going to be a person who regularly attends live sports: it&#8217;s too crowded, too noisy, and I don&#8217;t care enough about the action happening on the field. But I&#8217;m really glad to have gone once. It was a lot of fun to explore the stadium and see a few glimpses of what goes in to putting on a baseball game. Thanks Microsoft for bringing me to a fun event! </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A while ago I arbitrarily decided that I needed a favourite three-digit number (don’t ask) and ended up choosing 216. It’s a nice cube number —&nbsp;6×6×6&nbsp;— and can also be expressed as a sum of three smaller cubes:</p>



<div class="wp-block-katex-display-block katex-eq" data-katex-display="true"><pre>6^3 = 5^3 + 4^3 + 3^3</pre></div>



<span id="more-163"></span>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/216_(number)">Wikipedia article for the number</a>&nbsp;has&nbsp;<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Plato_number.svg">a diagram</a>&nbsp;showing one way to reassemble a 6×6×6 cube into three smaller cubes, but I’ve been playing around looking for other, more aesthetically pleasing methods. Here’s one I found.</p>



<p>First, we break the 6×6×6 cube into its 4×4×4 interior, six 4×4×1 faces, twelve 4×1×1 edges, and eight 1×1×1 corners<sup data-fn="3dde39ee-627c-411e-9090-1effecda7ff5" class="fn"><a href="#3dde39ee-627c-411e-9090-1effecda7ff5" id="3dde39ee-627c-411e-9090-1effecda7ff5-link">1</a></sup>: i.e.,</p>



<div class="wp-block-katex-display-block katex-eq" data-katex-display="true"><pre>6^3 = 4^3 + 6\cdot 4^2 + 12\cdot 4^1 + 8 \cdot 4^0</pre></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async"  src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/216.svg" alt="An exploded-view diagram of a cube separated into an interior, faces, edges, and corners." class="wp-image-208"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Decomposing the cube according to its polytope boundaries.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The 4×4×1 faces can be combined with seven of the edges and one of the corners to build a 5×5×5 cube. The remaining five edges can be split into ten 2×1×1 chunks and arranged with the remaining seven corners to form a 3×3×3 cube.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async"  src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rearrange.svg" alt="An exploded-view diagram of a 3×3×3 cube and a 5×5×5 cube using the pieces of the 6×6×6 cube from before." class="wp-image-209"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Rearranging the pieces into smaller cubes.</figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async"  src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cubes.svg" alt="The unexploded view of the 3×3×3, 4×4×4, and 5×5×5 cubes made from the pieces of the 6×6×6 cube." class="wp-image-210"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The final three cubes.</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are many more ways to construct three cubes from the pieces of a 6×6×6 cube. What’s your favourite?</p>


<ol class="wp-block-footnotes"><li id="3dde39ee-627c-411e-9090-1effecda7ff5">As an aside, this decomposition can be done with any size cube and even in any number of dimensions.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> calls your attention to the sky… but there’s more weird stuff up there than just the floating islands.</p>



<span id="more-153"></span>



<p>If you look into Hyrule’s sky at night, you’ll see the <strong>stars do not move</strong> while the moon races from one horizon to the other.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/moon.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The moon moves across a fixed starfield.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This means that the cosmology of the <em>Zelda</em> universe is significantly different from our own; if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_Revolution">Copernicus</a> was Hylian he’d have stuck with a geocentric model.<sup data-fn="2c82e157-3611-45f1-a3f1-1f56bc34e73b" class="fn"><a href="#2c82e157-3611-45f1-a3f1-1f56bc34e73b" id="2c82e157-3611-45f1-a3f1-1f56bc34e73b-link">1</a></sup></p>



<p>That’s not the only astronomical oddity in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. <strong>The sun’s position at sunrise and sunset doesn’t make sense</strong>. On Earth, the sun doesn’t always rise and set <em>exactly</em> in the east and west. In the (boreal) summer, the sun rises and sets further north, providing us in the Northern Hemisphere with more hours of sunlight each day.</p>



<p>Here in the Vancouver summer, the sun currently rises 38° north of east and sets 38° north of west. In <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> the sun rises around 4:00 and sets around 9:00,<sup data-fn="9c229a3c-bc95-4c91-90c6-3cc9a8526925" class="fn"><a href="#9c229a3c-bc95-4c91-90c6-3cc9a8526925" id="9c229a3c-bc95-4c91-90c6-3cc9a8526925-link">2</a></sup> so you’d expect them to happen at similar angles instead of due east and west.</p>



<p>This is more evidence towards a geocentric model of Hylian cosmology, since the day-night cycle can be explained if the sun’s orbit around the world intersects Hyrule but its center does not.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/24hours.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A 24-hour cycle of sunrise and moonrise.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The strangest phenomenon I noticed is the fact that <strong>moon only appears at night</strong>. Sure, we culturally associate the moon with night, but in reality it’s out during the day half the time. This is what gives the moon <a href="https://moon.nasa.gov/moon-in-motion/phases-eclipses-supermoons/moon-phases/">its phases</a>; the closer the moon is to the sun in the sky, the less of it appears illuminated to us on Earth. If the moon always rises and sets at the same time of day, its phases cannot be explained as the reflected light of the sun!</p>



<p>The simplest explanation would be that Link is observing the rotation of a moon with one luminescent side, but I looked closely and the half-moon has the same face as the full moon. This means that, like Earth’s moon, the Hylian moon is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking">tidally locked</a><sup data-fn="413f2cee-ede6-45ee-a0fe-4e09834d120a" class="fn"><a href="#413f2cee-ede6-45ee-a0fe-4e09834d120a" id="413f2cee-ede6-45ee-a0fe-4e09834d120a-link">3</a></sup> and always shows the same face.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="1200" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/zelda-astronomy-model.png" alt="A diagram of a possible Zelda planetary system." class="wp-image-191" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/zelda-astronomy-model.png 1600w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/zelda-astronomy-model-800x600.png 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/zelda-astronomy-model-768x576.png 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/zelda-astronomy-model-1536x1152.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A model for the cosmology of the world of Zelda.</figcaption></figure>



<p>My best theory is that the moon is made of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence">fluorescent</a> material and is orbited by a small body that emits ultraviolet or other high-energy light in the non-visible spectrum. Do you have an alternative headcanon theory?</p>


<ol class="wp-block-footnotes"><li id="2c82e157-3611-45f1-a3f1-1f56bc34e73b">Technically, a fixed starfield is also consistent with a heliocentric model where stars are small luminous objects embedded on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_spheres">celestial sphere</a> rotating around and at the same rate as the world. But that model doesn’t explain the other oddities in this post. <a href="#2c82e157-3611-45f1-a3f1-1f56bc34e73b-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote reference 1"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />︎</a></li><li id="9c229a3c-bc95-4c91-90c6-3cc9a8526925">Sunrise and sunset times in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> varies with location and elevation. With enough precise measurements, you could in theory figure out whether the world of <em>Zelda</em> world is flat or round — if you want to be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</a> of Hyrule and compute the size of the planet, please let me know your results! <a href="#9c229a3c-bc95-4c91-90c6-3cc9a8526925-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote reference 2"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />︎</a></li><li id="413f2cee-ede6-45ee-a0fe-4e09834d120a">Speaking of tidal forces, the fact that Hyrule has no discernable tides on its coastline suggests that its moon is significantly smaller and closer than Earth’s moon, which would be consistent with the events depicted in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Majora%27s_Mask"><em>Majora’s Mask</em></a>. <a href="#413f2cee-ede6-45ee-a0fe-4e09834d120a-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote reference 3"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />︎</a></li></ol>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I recently went for a walk in təmtəmíxʷtən (Belcarra), and when I got to… wait, what’s that weird derelict building in the distance?</p>



<span id="more-151"></span>



<p>Is it an abandoned hotel? No, there’s no way to get there by land. An old naval fortress? No, the location doesn’t make any strategic sense. A hydroelectric dam? Where’s the water behind it?</p>



<p>As it turns out, it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a power plant!&nbsp;<a href="https://montecristomagazine.com/community/the-buntzen-lake-powerhouses">Buntzen generating station #2</a>, completed in 1914, was built to supplement the output of BC’s first-ever hydroelectric plant up-inlet. Both stations were powered by water delivered by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penstock">penstocks</a>&nbsp;from Buntzen Lake, which in turn was supplied with water from Coquitlam Lake via a 4km-long tunnel.</p>



<p>Buntzen station #1&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bchydro.com/energy-in-bc/operations/our-facilities/lower-mainland.html">is still functional</a>&nbsp;and supplies 60 megawatts of power to the Metro Vancouver area. Buntzen #2 was shut down at the turn of the millennium and serves as a historic curiosity for kayakers in səl̓ilw̓ət (Indian Arm).</p>

<p>Julius Caesar’s given name was Gaius. &#8220;Julius&#8221; and &#8220;Caesar&#8221; were both family names (Caesar being a branch of the Julia family).</p>



<p>In his time, he was referred to as&nbsp;<em>Gaius Caesar</em> or simply as <em>Caesar</em> by <a href="https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Commentarii_de_bello_Gallico">himself</a> and <a href="https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Pro_Marcello">his contemporaries</a>. Calling him &#8220;Julius Caesar&#8221; would have been redundant since every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julii_Caesares">Caesar</a> was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_gens">Julius</a>.</p>



<p>The Romans had a lot of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_naming_conventions">traditions</a>&nbsp;around names.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Julius_Caesar_(name)">Gaius Julius Caesar</a>&nbsp;inherited his name from his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.</p>



<p>Caesar’s great-nephew&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Gaius Octavius Thurinus</a>&nbsp;also took the name Gaius Julius Caesar when he inherited the assassinated dictator’s estate. To prevent confusion, he’s often called&nbsp;<em>Octavianus</em>, which is more or less the ancient Roman equivalent to &#8220;the artist formerly known as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)">Prince</a>&#8220;. The emperor&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula">Caligula</a>, Octavian’s great-grandson, was also named Gaius Caesar; we know him by a nickname he received as a small child.</p>

<p>Between cabbage, lettuce, maple, and holly, two plants are in the rosid clade (related to roses) and two are in the asterid clade (related to sunflowers). Can you guess which is which?</p>



<span id="more-143"></span>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="900" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/taxonomy-jpg.webp" alt="A two-by-two grid of plant photos. Clockwise from top left: a maple tree, a holly tree, a lettuce plant, and a cabbage plant." class="wp-image-213" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/taxonomy-jpg.webp 1600w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/taxonomy-800x450.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/taxonomy-768x432.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/taxonomy-1536x864.webp 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>I would have guessed that the trees might be related to a woody rose bush, while the leafy greens would be closer to broad-leaved sunflowers. I would have been wrong. Plants are <em>much</em> weirder than that.</p>



<p>In fact, cabbages are much more closely related to maple trees than they are to lettuce;&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica_oleracea">cabbage</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple">maples</a>&nbsp;are both&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosids">rosids</a>. Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly">holly trees</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lettuce">lettuce</a>&nbsp;are both&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterids">asterids</a>.</p>



<p>As it turns out, a lot of the categories we use to think about plants — trees, bushes, berries, vegetables, and so on — are not particularly unique from an genetic perspective. Biologist Georgia Ray&nbsp;<a href="https://eukaryotewritesblog.com/2021/05/02/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-tree/">explains</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>On the evolutionary tree of plants, trees are regularly interspersed with things that are&nbsp;<em>absolutely, 100%</em>&nbsp;not trees. This means that, for instance:</p>



<ul>
<li>The common ancestor of a maple and a mulberry tree was not a tree.</li>



<li>The common ancestor of a stinging nettle and a strawberry plant was a tree.</li>



<li>And this is true for most trees or non-trees that you can think of.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of this, there are plenty of plant lists you can play &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_of_These_Things_(Is_Not_Like_the_Others)">One of these things is not like the others</a>&#8221;&nbsp;with where the intuitive answer is very different from the phylogenetic answer.</p>

<p>Every new emoji starts with a formal proposal justifying why it should exist. The proposal for <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1faf5.png" alt="🫵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> starts with four pages of the history of people pointing at the viewer in art.</p>



<span id="more-141"></span>



<p>Only a few emoji are accepted every year, but anyone can submit suggestions for new emoji. For example:</p>



<ul>
<li><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1fabc.png" alt="🪼" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2021/21217-jellyfish-emoji.pdf">proposed</a>&nbsp;by marine biologists.</li>



<li><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1fa97.png" alt="🪗" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2019/19087-accordion-emoji.pdf">proposed</a>&nbsp;by accordion historian&nbsp;<a href="https://accordionuprising.wordpress.com/about/">Bruce Triggs</a></li>



<li><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1fad8.png" alt="🫘" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> was <a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2020/20226-beans-emoji.pdf">proposed</a> by someone who just enjoys &#8220;chowing down on the occasional bowl of baked beans.&#8221;</li>
</ul>



<p>To address the Unicode Consortium’s&nbsp;<a href="https://unicode.org/emoji/proposals.html">emoji selection criteria</a>, you’ll find proposals arguing things like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2016/16304-fantasy-creatures.pdf">mermaids are 522% more popular than goblins</a>&nbsp;or that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2019/19103-teapot-emoji.pdf">teapots are not too similar to teacups</a>. Older emoji didn’t go through the same kind of selection process, which is presumably why there are three separate emoji for optical computer media: <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4c0.png" alt="📀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4bf.png" alt="💿" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4bd.png" alt="💽" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />.</p>



<p>You can find most emoji proposals linked from their&nbsp;<a href="https://emojipedia.org/">Emojipedia</a>&nbsp;page. Here are a few interesting or funny submissions I’ve seen. (All quotations&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sixthcircuitappellateblog.com/uncategorized/a-brief-history-and-status-of-cleaned-up-in-the-sixth-circuit/#page=1">cleaned up</a>.)</p>

<p>The interest in dinosaurs is even stronger than the Google Trends comparisons suggest. People do not search for news on dinosaur attacks, as they would on sharks, lions, snakes, and alligators.

<p>Books about dinosaurs range from nonfiction descriptions of the now-extinct animals, to fictional thrillers, like Michael Crichton’s Jurassic Park, to the 488 (!!) books identified as &#8220;Dinosaur Erotica&#8221; in Amazon’s Kindle store.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em><a href="https://archive.org/details/CRCHandbookOfChemistryAndPhysics97thEdition2016">CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics</a></em>&nbsp;is a 2600-page tome of random facts and figures, from the speed of sound in various media to the chemical composition of the human body.</p>



<p>My sixth-grade teacher’s copy was one of the most fascinating objects of my childhood, and it still makes me giggle with delight.</p>



<span id="more-136"></span>



<p>To give a taste of what the book is like, here’s an abridged version of 15-39 &#8220;Density of various solids&#8221;. The idea that someone would need a handy reference for the density of cardboard, sandstone, butter, and thirty-eight different kinds of wood is hilarious — but they must be the most interesting person in the world!</p>

<p>I’m on a quest to explore the creeks and waterways of Vancouver, Burnaby, and New Westminster. First, I need to understand how the topography of my neighbourhood determines the flow of water and the formation of streams.</p>



<span id="more-134"></span>

<p>Three main topological features define how water flows in the Vancouver-Burnaby-New West area:</p>



<ul>
<li>a chain of hills running along səl̓ilw̓ət (Burrard Inlet) from East Vancouver to Coquitlam, including Capitol Hill and lhuḵw’lkuḵw’áyten (Burnaby Mountain);</li>



<li>a ridge extending from t̕θəcəliʔqʷ (UBC) to sχʷeyəməɬ (New Westminster) along the southern half of the peninsula, with peaks at Little Mountain and the Metrotown area; and</li>



<li>weirdly enough, a barely perceptible incline between Nanaimo Street and Renfrew Street in East Vancouver.</li>
</ul>



<p>These features divide the Burrard Peninsula into four watersheds, which determine where a falling raindrop will flow</p>



<ul>
<li>north, into səl̓ilw̓ət (Burrard Inlet),</li>



<li>northwest, into False Creek/English Bay,</li>



<li>south, into stal̓əw̓ (the Fraser River), or</li>



<li>east, through Still Creek, Burnaby Lake, and the Brunette River, before returning west via stal̓əw̓ (the Fraser River).</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="900" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vancouver-watersheds.png" alt="A topographic map of the Burrard Peninsula, divided into four coloured regions as described above." class="wp-image-236" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vancouver-watersheds.png 1600w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vancouver-watersheds-800x450.png 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vancouver-watersheds-768x432.png 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vancouver-watersheds-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The main watersheds of the Burrard Peninsula.</figcaption></figure>



<p>(More detailed watershed maps can be found on the websites of the&nbsp;<a href="https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/one-water-watershed-characterization.pdf">City of Vancouver</a> and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.burnaby.ca/sites/default/files/acquiadam/2021-07/Waterways%20of%20Burnaby.pdf">City of Burnaby</a>.)</p>



<p>Most of the&nbsp;<a href="http://hdl.handle.net/11272/IKHNQ">historic streams</a>&nbsp;of Vancouver have been developed over, so rainwater now is mainly conveyed through storm drains and groundwater. In contrast, Burnaby still has plenty of streams carrying rain through its watersheds.</p>



<p>I’ll be exploring these streams and attempting to trace them from source to mouth. Stay tuned for more!</p>

<p>This picture illustrates the danger of poorly-designed streets, which the Swedish government set out to improve in the 1990s. It was originally created by Swedish artist <a href="http://www.jilg.com/">Karl Jilg</a>, who was commissioned by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Road_Administration">Swedish Road Administration</a> to explain new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_Zero">Vision Zero</a> initiatives.</p>



<span id="more-132"></span>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-23176-7_8-1">ideas</a>&nbsp;behind the initiatives were that</p>



<ol>
<li>The responsibility for preventing deaths and injuries on the road transportation system partly rests with the people who design that infrastructure, and</li>



<li>Deaths and injuries on the road ultimately come down to kinetic energy.</li>
</ol>



<p>The picture is intended to turn the kinetic energy of a moving car into a height to show the consequences of simple human mistakes in the road system. Research shows that the highest acceptable speed on a street with active users like this is 30km/h.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="800" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jilg-sidewalk-jpeg.webp" alt="An illustration of a city block with bottomless pits for streets." class="wp-image-227" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jilg-sidewalk-jpeg.webp 600w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jilg-sidewalk-450x600.webp 450w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Pedestrians navigate the dangerous chasms of city streets. (Karl Jilg / Vägverket)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The image has been widely shared, thanks in part to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/11/18/7236471/cars-pedestrians-sidewalks-roads">a 2014 Vox article</a>&nbsp;that used it to call attention to other pedestrian-hostile aspects about many cities’ street designs:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Most roads in the US are built for cars, not for pedestrians. This brilliant illustration shows just how lopsided the the proportions of a normal urban street corner really are.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The city sidewalk picture is just one of a series of four that Jilg illustrated for the Swedish government. The other one I found is set on a highway.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="800" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jilg-canyon-jpeg.webp" alt="An illustration of a car speeding along a road high in the mountains." class="wp-image-228" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jilg-canyon-jpeg.webp 600w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jilg-canyon-450x600.webp 450w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A car moving at highway speeds has a lot of kinetic energy. (Karl Jilg / Vägverket)</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’m not sure whether Jilg did any calculations to create these, but a head-on collision between two cars at highway speed is approximately equivalent to a single car being dropped from a height of 200m. Sweden added median barriers to many highways in the late ’90s, which reduced the incidence of head-on collisions and the risk of fatalities by 80%.</p>



<p>I have unfortunately not been able to find the other two illustrations in the set. Jilg has, however, done other work for the Swedish government.</p>

<p>Leah and I have really gotten into Magic: the Gathering. Our favourite ways to play are&nbsp;<a href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Sealed_Deck">sealed deck</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Jumpstart_(format)">Jumpstart</a>, both of which involve opening new packs and making decks out of what you open.</p>



<p>Since it would be wasteful (not to mention expensive) to buy new cards every time we play, we only buy a certain number of packs each set and re-use the cards we open to make our own packs for later games.</p>



<span id="more-128"></span>

<p>We originally tried coin envelopes and a product called&nbsp;<a href="https://cardamajigs.com/collections/cubeamajigs">Cubeamajigs</a>, but neither was as nice or convenient as the side-loading papercraft boxes I made with my&nbsp;<a href="https://cricut.com/en-ca/">Cricut</a>.</p>



<p>The above SVG image can be imported into Cricut Design Space to make boxes of your own. Or, if you want to make a box with different dimensions, a tool called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.templatemaker.nl/en/cardbox/">Templatemaker</a>&nbsp;can make similar patterns.</p>

<p>You can get a really good approximation of a sinusoidal curve from twelve equally-spaced line segments of slope 1/12, 2/12, 3/12, 3/12, 2/12, 1/12, -1/12, -2/12, -3/12, -3/12, -2/12, and -1/12, respectively.</p>



<p>This approximation, known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_twelfths">rule of twelfths</a>, rounds √3≈5/3​ but otherwise uses exact values along the curve.</p>



<p>I learned about the rule of twelfths from a kayaking instructor and guide, who used it to estimate the tides. In locations and seasons with a&nbsp;<a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/tutorial_tides/tides07_cycles.html">semidiurnal tide pattern</a>, the period of the tide is roughly 12 hours, and the rule of twelfths tells you what the water will be doing in each hour.</p>



<p>For example, if you know that the difference between low and high tide is 3 feet, then you can quickly estimate that it the tide will rise by about 3 inches in the first hour, 6 inches in the second, 9 inches in the third and fourth, 6 inches in the fifth hour, and 3 inches in the last hour before high tide.</p>

<p>Recently I&#8217;ve been spending my spare time doing two things: solving cryptic crosswords and playing <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>. The next logical step, then, is to try my hand at compiling my own cryptic crossword themed after the game!</p>



<span id="more-319"></span>



<p>If you haven&#8217;t tried one before, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptic_crossword">cryptic crossword</a> is a crossword puzzle in which each clue is itself a word puzzle. A cryptic clue is usually misleading if taken at face value, but conceals a definition and a secondary indication (usually wordplay) of the correct answer. For example:</p>



<details class="wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow"><summary>A gym leader in Cinnabar was inflamed (5)</summary>
<p>The answer is <strong>RAGED</strong>, meaning &#8220;was inflamed&#8221;.</p>



<p>At first reading, it seems like this clue refers to the fiery Cinnabar Island Gym Leader <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Blaine">Blaine</a> from Pokémon Red and Blue, but the hidden real definition is only the last two words, &#8220;was inflamed&#8221;.</p>



<p>The remainder of the clue is wordplay that hints at the answer: &#8220;Cinnabar&#8221; means RED and &#8220;gym leader&#8221; can be interpreted as &#8220;the first letter of gym&#8221;, so &#8220;A gym leader in Cinnabar&#8221; reduces to &#8220;A G in RED&#8221; — hence, RAGED.</p>
</details>



<p>Cryptic clues can be even more complicated and include anagrams, homophones, obscure abbreviations, and all sorts of other devices. Or they can be as simple as a bad pun.</p>



<details class="wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow"><summary>Feet passed down through generations? (7)</summary>
<p>The answer is <strong>LEGENDS</strong>, which are &#8220;passed down through generations&#8221;. What do feet have to do with anything? Well, they&#8217;re LEG ENDS, of course&#8230;</p>
</details>



<p>You&#8217;ll need to be a Pokémon fan to appreciate all of the surface readings in this puzzle, but don&#8217;t worry if you aren&#8217;t — none of the clues require any specific knowledge of Pokémon to solve. Once you&#8217;re done, you can go to page 2 to check the solutions and see how you did. Enjoy!</p>

<p>You know what a fire hydrant looks like. You pass by them every day, and they&#8217;re all painted to be a highly visible red. Or is it yellow? Wait, maybe they have other colours on them too?</p>



<span id="more-886"></span>



<p>If the subject of fire hydrant colours has ever crossed your mind, you might have assumed (as I did) that they&#8217;d be covered somewhere in the <a href="https://nrc.canada.ca/en/certifications-evaluations-standards/codes-canada/codes-canada-publications/national-fire-code-canada-2020">Fire Code</a>. In fact, the code is completely silent on hydrant colours, and it&#8217;s up to individual municipalities and their fire departments to decide how hydrants should be painted. This leaves a lot of room for variation!</p>



<p>Even setting aside exceptional cases — like downtown Quesnel&#8217;s <a href="https://www.quesnel.ca/our-community/visiting/walking-tours/painted-fire-hydrant-walking-tour">artistic hydrants</a>, or that time an Abbotsford neighbourhood got <a href="https://www.abbynews.com/news/how-an-abbotsford-neighbourhood-got-and-lost-its-gold-plated-hydrants-1797959">gold-plated hydrants</a> — there&#8217;s a wide variety in the colour schemes used across municipalities in BC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The non-standard standard</h2>



<p>A document called NFPA 291, published by the US-based National Fire Protection Association, is the closest thing there is to a standard fire hydrant colour scheme. It recommends that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>[P]ublic hydrant barrels are to be colored their characteristic chrome yellow. … The tops and nozzle caps are also painted under a capacity-indicating color scheme to provide simplicity and consistency. This scheme consists of Light Blue [for hydrants that can pump 1500 gallons per minute], Green [1000-1499 gpm], Orange [500-999 gpm], and Red [less than 500 gpm].</p>
<cite><a href="https://blog.ansi.org/2018/09/nfpa-291-2019-fire-hydrant-flow-test-marking/">ANSI</a>, describing NFPA 291</cite></blockquote>



<p>Although many NFPA standards are incorporated into the Canadian Fire Code, the NFPA 291 colour scheme is purely voluntary.</p>



<p>Many municipalities incorporate the recommended flow rate colours into their hydrant designs, but only a few — notably Kelowna, Chilliwack, and Merritt — implement the full standard including the chrome yellow body.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Vancouver</h2>



<p>In the city of Vancouver, most fire hydrants are painted entirely red. Each hydrant has a label indicating the flow rate (as per the NFPA 291 colour code) and an alphanumeric identifier that can be looked up on the <a href="https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/water-hydrants/information/">on the city website</a> to find the make, model, and installation date.</p>

<p>Downtown, you&#8217;ll also see fire hydrants of a different colour. These large blue hydrants are part of the <a href="https://spacing.ca/vancouver/2014/11/10/doors-open-vancouver-false-creek-pump-station/">Dedicated Fire Protection System</a>, an auxiliary network that can supply enough water pressure to reach the tops of high-rise buildings. The network was built to withstand magnitude 8 earthquakes after the successful use of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1193/1.2186678">a similar system in San Francisco</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Burnaby</h2>

<p>The city of Burnaby might have a claim to the province&#8217;s most distinctive fire hydrants. Their <a href="https://www.burnaby.ca/sites/default/files/acquiadam/2021-08/Supplementary-Specifications-and-Detail-Drawings.pdf">red, white, and green</a> colour scheme isn&#8217;t found anywhere else in BC.</p>

<p>The Burnaby tricolour apparently only applies to public hydrants. The shopping centres at Market Crossing, for example, installed boring red fire hydrants on their parking lots.</p>

<p>My hometown of Kamloops mostly paints its hydrants <a href="https://www.kamloops.ca/sites/default/files/docs/safety-bylaws/hydranttestingstandards.pdf">yellow with a white bonnet</a>.</p>



<p>The largest port of a Kamloops hydrant exhibits another colour code that can be found across the province. The main cap can either be yellow or black depending on whether it is threaded or uses a <a href="https://blog.qrfs.com/16-what-is-a-storz-connection-and-how-does-it-work/">Storz connection</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hope</h2>



<p>Downtown Hope&#8217;s red hydrants have little antennae attached to make them more visible, especially in cases of heavy snow.</p>

<p>The above table is not foolproof. It is hard to tell, for example, whether Williams Lake has adopted a uniform yellow-and-green colour scheme for aesthetic reasons or it just happens to have a lot of 1000 gpm hydrants painted according to NFPA 291.</p>



<p>I also saw one instance of a hydrant in Comox that appears either yellow or red in Street View depending on the angle; one image was taken in 2012 and the other in 2022, and the hydrant had apparently been repainted in the interim.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Fire hydrant colours are left to each municipality, and frequently lack public documentation. I&#8217;ve done a quick survey of what&#8217;s out there, but I&#8217;ve surely missed many exceptions, oddities, and quirks in each municipality. Pay attention to the hydrants in your neighbourhood and you&#8217;ll surely notice something interesting!</p>

If there&#8217;s a particular ice cream truck song that annoys you all summer, you have the Nichols Electronics Company to blame.</p>



<p>(You could always ask the your local driver if they&#8217;re able to switch it up — if they have one of the Omni models, they could change it to one of <a href="https://www.nicholselectronics.com/our-songs" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nicholselectronics.com/our-songs">thirty-one other songs</a>.)</p>



<p>Historically, ice cream truck music boxes <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199913657.013.005" data-type="link" data-id="https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199913657.013.005">were a sonic callback</a> to late 19th-century ice cream parlors and soda fountains, which had coin-operated music boxes before phonographs were invented and jukeboxes could become a thing.</p>

<p>Highway exits in Canada are generally numbered based on the distance (in km) from the beginning of the highway. But what about before Canada <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrication_in_Canada">went metric</a>? Did all the exits have to be renumbered?</p>



<p>As it turns out, my assumption that distance-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_number">exit numbering</a> is not as widespread or as recent as I thought.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Ontario and Québec have exit numbering systems that predate metrication, but only barely, so the switch wasn&#8217;t too hard.</li>



<li>Newfoundland and Nova Scotia have <em>sequential</em> exit numbers, not distance-based ones.</li>



<li>Alberta didn&#8217;t post exit numbers at all until 2004!</li>
</ul>

<span id="more-848"></span>



<p>Here&#8217;s what I came up with. The following is a normal American-style <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossword">crossword puzzle</a> — no cryptic clues <a href="https://rosschurchley.com/2022/legends-a-pokemon-themed-cryptic-crossword/">this time</a> — with 24 seven-letter answers. Once you&#8217;re done solving the crossword, write down the seven-letter entries and see if you can group them into six categories of four words each, like a jumbo-sized version of Connections. Good luck!</p>

<p>Cricket has a bit of a reputation for being hard to understand, but it&#8217;s actually a simpler game than the most popular North American sports.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s everything you need to know to enjoy a cricket match in 600 words or less.</p>



<span id="more-482"></span>



<p>Cricket is played on an oval field with a rectangular pitch in the middle. Two players on the batting team stand on either side of the pitch; the eleven players on the fielding team take up positions around the field.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="713" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/oval-jpg.webp" alt="A wide angle of a cricket match in progress." class="wp-image-487" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/oval-jpg.webp 1600w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/oval-800x357.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/oval-768x342.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/oval-1536x684.webp 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This wide angle shows nine of the England fielders in red (two are out of frame to the right), two New Zealand batters in black, and two umpires.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Runs</h2>



<p>The cricket ball is bowled overarm by a player on the fielding team and can bounce once. The batter hits the ball and switches ends with the other batter, scoring one run each time this happens.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Delivery.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A typical delivery is bowled and hit for a single run. The batter can choose not to run if they don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll make it in time.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If the batter hits the ball all the way to the boundary of the field, they score four runs automatically.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Boundary-Four.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>If they hit the ball really hard over the boundary, they score six runs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Boundary-Six.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A ball hit into the stands is worth six runs — but the crowd has to give it back so the same ball can be used for the whole innings.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wickets</h2>



<p>The goal of the fielding team is to get the batters out (&#8220;take their wickets&#8221;) before they score lots of runs.</p>



<p>The batter is <strong>out caught</strong> if they hit the ball and a fielder catches it before it hits the ground.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wicket-Caught.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Out caught is the most common form of dismissal in cricket.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The batter is <strong>out bowled</strong> if they miss and the ball hits the wicket behind them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wicket-Bowled.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Some games have fancy stumps and bails that light up when the wicket is broken.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The batter is <strong>out leg before wicket</strong> if they use their body to block the ball from hitting the wicket.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wicket-LBW.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A batter is out LBW if the ball hits their body and would have gone on to hit the wicket.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The batter is <strong>run out</strong> if they run and the fielding side breaks the wicket before they&#8217;re safe.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wicket-Run-out.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">To be safe, the batter&#8217;s body or bat must be touching the ground behind the white line.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The batter is <strong>out stumped</strong> if they come too far out, miss the ball, and get run out by the wicketkeeper.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wicket-Stumped.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The wicketkeeper stumps the batter by breaking the wicket with the ball or their hand holding the ball.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overs</h2>



<p>Every six balls<sup data-fn="99fed2f4-c6f7-45ae-9262-1e7a4f82165b" class="fn"><a href="#99fed2f4-c6f7-45ae-9262-1e7a4f82165b" id="99fed2f4-c6f7-45ae-9262-1e7a4f82165b-link">1</a></sup>, the fielders switch ends and a different player from the fielding team comes on to bowl. Six balls is also called an <strong>over</strong>.</p>



<p>Each team gets to bat for 20 overs<sup data-fn="99ce75d3-e31e-4847-9632-c32296b65a09" class="fn"><a href="#99ce75d3-e31e-4847-9632-c32296b65a09" id="99ce75d3-e31e-4847-9632-c32296b65a09-link">2</a></sup> or until they have lost ten wickets. Whichever team has the most runs after both sides bat wins.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Extras</h2>



<p>There are a bunch of rules that govern how the ball should be bowled. A violation results in a do-over, except the batting team is awarded an extra run and gets to keep any runs they scored off the illegal delivery.</p>



<p>A <strong>wide</strong> is signalled if the umpire judges that the ball was bowled too wide or too high for it to be reasonably hit.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Extra-Wide.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The umpire signals a wide by stretching their arms out.</figcaption></figure>



<p>A <strong>no ball</strong> is signalled if the bowler steps too far over the white line while bowling.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/No-ball.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Overstepping is the most common way a no ball is called against a bowler.</figcaption></figure>



<p>A no ball also turns the next ball into a &#8220;free hit&#8221;, meaning the batter is immune from getting out caught, bowled, stumped, or LBW off that ball.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Positions</h2>



<p>A typical team roster has some specialist <strong>batters</strong> who usually don&#8217;t bowl, some specialist <strong>bowlers</strong> who aren&#8217;t expected to get lots of runs, and some <strong>all-rounders</strong> who are good at both batting and bowling.</p>



<p>There are two main bowling styles: <strong>fast bowlers</strong> rely on the speed of their deliveries while <strong>spin bowlers</strong> deliver slow but tricky balls.</p>



<p>Each team has a <strong>wicketkeeper</strong> who stops the balls that get past the batter. You can recognize the wicketkeeper as the only fielder who wears gloves.</p>



<p>Fielders can be deployed anywhere, subject to a few restrictions.<sup data-fn="1d6b6fa8-d61b-403f-b70b-2587dd8c9711" class="fn"><a href="#1d6b6fa8-d61b-403f-b70b-2587dd8c9711" id="1d6b6fa8-d61b-403f-b70b-2587dd8c9711-link">3</a></sup> Commentators describe fielding positions using funny names like slip, gully, mid-off, square leg, and third man. You don&#8217;t need to memorize these.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Scoreboard</h2>



<p>A typical TV broadcast overlay displays the following information:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The batting team&#8217;s current run total and wickets lost.<sup data-fn="c2ccf6cd-bb84-4278-a55f-12365bf3377f" class="fn"><a href="#c2ccf6cd-bb84-4278-a55f-12365bf3377f" id="c2ccf6cd-bb84-4278-a55f-12365bf3377f-link">4</a></sup></li>



<li>The number of overs completed or the number of balls remaining.</li>



<li>The<strong> </strong>current batters&#8217; names, runs scored, and balls faced, with some indication of which batter is facing the next ball.</li>



<li>The current bowler.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>That&#8217;s all you need to follow and enjoy a cricket match! All that&#8217;s left to learn is a few bits of jargon, the names of the players, and the details of whatever tournament or competition you want to follow. You&#8217;ll pick up all of those as you go.</p>



<p>Some tournaments worth following are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup">Men&#8217;s Twenty20 World Cup</a> (this June).</li>



<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Women%27s_T20_World_Cup">Women&#8217;s Twenty20 World Cup</a> (this October). </li>



<li>England&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehundred.com/">The Hundred</a> (August).</li>



<li>Australia&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cricket.com.au/big-bash">Big Bash League</a> (December–January).</li>



<li>India&#8217;s <a href="https://www.iplt20.com/">IPL</a> (April–May) and <a href="https://www.wplt20.com/">WPL</a> (March).</li>
</ul>



<p>National sides often play <a href="https://www.icc-cricket.com/fixtures-results">series against each other</a> as well.</p>



<p>If you want to watch cricket, most series are carried in Canada by subscription streaming service <a href="https://www.willow.tv/">Willow TV</a>. You can also follow live text summaries and scorecards on sites like <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/">ESPN Cricinfo</a>.</p>

<p>I recently attended a Seattle Mariners game as part of a Microsoft event. It was my first time at a baseball game, so I recorded a bunch of observations about the experience.</p>



<span id="more-457"></span>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The stadium experience</h2>



<p>This was my first time attending any professional sport in person, so I didn&#8217;t have any idea what to expect. I checked the <a href="https://www.mlb.com/mariners/ballpark/information/guide">stadium rules</a> in advance and found I could bring my camera, but not my camera bag or any of my larger lenses. Fortunately, my wide-angle lens and 20–55mm kit lens — both barely within the regulations — were enough to get some interesting photos.</p>



<p>A big part of the ballpark experience is being able to wander around the stadium; I spent at least half the game exploring rather than sitting in my assigned seat. There&#8217;s a lot to look at and do in the stadium, and as long as you&#8217;re not blocking anyone&#8217;s view during an at-bat, there&#8217;s remarkable freedom to walk around the aisles and see the field from different angles.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Baseball is complicated</h2>



<p>Many of the Microsoft employees at the game — including myself — are more familiar with cricket than with baseball. Cricket has a reputation in North America for being hard to understand, but when I compare my <a href="https://rosschurchley.com/2024/cricket-in-600-words-or-less/">beginner&#8217;s guide to cricket</a> with our deliberations our section had to understand what was going on, I realized that baseball is <em>much</em> more complicated.</p>

<details class="wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow"><summary>Can you decipher these scoreboards?</summary>
<p>The bottom of the screen is the easiest to understand. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_zone">Balls, strikes</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)">outs</a> are fundamental to the game and relatively easy to explain to a newcomer<sup data-fn="d2bd537f-6e0d-41e2-aeaa-ec28deb4b285" class="fn"><a href="#d2bd537f-6e0d-41e2-aeaa-ec28deb4b285" id="d2bd537f-6e0d-41e2-aeaa-ec28deb4b285-link">1</a></sup>. Each team&#8217;s current score is the total number of runs under the &#8220;R&#8221; column; columns 1–9 show how many runs were scored in each inning. The &#8220;H&#8221; column counts the number of hits resulting on a runner on base due to the batting team&#8217;s efforts; the &#8220;E&#8221; column counts the number of errors by the fielding team that allowed their opponent to get a runner on base. I had no idea what the acronym &#8220;MVR&#8221; stood for until a colleague expanded it to &#8220;mound visits remaining&#8221;; this refers to a kind of time out the fielding team can take to discuss strategy or switch pitchers.</p>



<p>The sides of the scoreboard display the current lineup of each team with jersey numbers and positions; the highlighted name tells you whose turn it is to bat. The batting lineup shows one other piece of information for each player:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>For players that have not yet batted in the inning, it shows the batting average.</li>



<li>For players that have batted already in the inning, it shows a <a href="https://www.mlb.com/glossary/miscellaneous/scorekeeping">cryptic acronym</a> that tells you the result of their at-bat.</li>



<li>For pitchers (who do not bat), I think it shows the pitcher&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average">earned runs average</a> (ERA) which is its own whole thing.</li>
</ul>



<p>On this scoreboard, we see that Seattle&#8217;s Dominic Canzone, who wears number 8 on his jersey, plays left field and is currently up to bat. His batting average is .219.</p>



<p>Three Seattle players have already batted this inning. Center fielder Raleigh had a single (1B), as did right fielder Raley. First baseman France is listed as having a &#8220;P3&#8221; which is apparently the acronym for &#8220;out after hitting a pop fly which was caught by the first baseman.&#8221;</p>



<p>Finally, the middle of the first scoreboard shows the statistics of the current batter. I had to look up most of the stats <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_statistics">on Wikipedia</a>:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th>Abbr</th><th>Value</th><th>Stat</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>G</td><td>15</td><td>Games</td><td>Number of games the batter has played in this year.</td></tr><tr><td>AB</td><td>32</td><td>At-bats</td><td>Number of opportunities the batter had to bat, more or less, except that walks and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat">some other outcomes</a> don&#8217;t count towards this statistic.</td></tr><tr><td>2B</td><td>1</td><td>Doubles</td><td>Number of hits on which the batter was able to safely reach second base.</td></tr><tr><td>3B</td><td>0</td><td>Triples</td><td>Number of hits on which the batter was able to safely reach third base.</td></tr><tr><td>BB</td><td>3</td><td>Bases on balls</td><td>Number of times the batter was awarded first base after four called balls. (Better known as &#8220;walks&#8221;.)</td></tr><tr><td>SO</td><td>11</td><td>Strikeouts</td><td>Number of times the batter was called out after three strikes.</td></tr><tr><td>SB</td><td>0</td><td>Stolen bases</td><td>Number of times the player was able to steal a base. There are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base">bunch of rules</a> about when a runner can steal a base and when something is scored under this statistic.</td></tr><tr><td>CS</td><td>0</td><td>Caught stealing</td><td>Number of times the player was tagged out while attempting to steal a base.</td></tr><tr><td>AVG</td><td>.219</td><td>Batting average</td><td>Percentage of at-bats where the batter hit the ball and safely reached a base.</td></tr><tr><td>R</td><td>4</td><td>Runs</td><td>Number of times the batter scored a run by crossing home plate.</td></tr><tr><td>H</td><td>7</td><td>Hits</td><td>Number of times the batter hit the ball and safely reached a base.</td></tr><tr><td>HR</td><td>3</td><td>Home runs</td><td>Number of hits on which the batter was able to safely touch all three bases and cross home plate. (Usually by hitting the ball into the crowd.)</td></tr><tr><td>RBI</td><td>6</td><td>Runs batted in</td><td>Number of times the batter&#8217;s action allowed another player to score a run.</td></tr><tr><td>OBP</td><td>.286</td><td>On-base percentage</td><td>Percentage of the time the batter gets on base, including being awarded first base for a walk or being hit by a pitch.</td></tr><tr><td>SLG</td><td>.531</td><td>Slugging percentage</td><td>Average number of bases achieved per at-bat.</td></tr><tr><td>OPS</td><td>.817</td><td>On-base plus slugging</td><td>OBP plus SLG, for some reason.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Phew, we finally understand the scoreboard on the left! Now we just need to figure out what &#8220;FC, E5, No RBI&#8221; is supposed to mean. This was displayed on the jumbotron after the following play:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://sporty-clips.mlb.com/V3k0RDlfWGw0TUFRPT1fVndFQUJnSUVYMWNBRFFZQlhnQUFVQWRTQUZrSFYxQUFBbDBFQmxKVFVsQUVBUXBY.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>&#8220;FC&#8221; stands for &#8220;fielder&#8217;s choice&#8221;, meaning that the third baseman chose to try to get the out at third instead of throwing it to first. This means the hit doesn&#8217;t count towards the batter&#8217;s statistics. The &#8220;E5&#8221; means the scorer decided that the Seattle players were safe because of the third baseman&#8217;s error. Finally, the run that scored during the play does not count as an RBI for the batter because if it weren&#8217;t for the error, there would have been three outs and the runner wouldn&#8217;t have scored.</p>



<p>All of this is to say: baseball is <em>complicated</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Spot the camera</h2>



<p>Before I came to the game I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLU9C9rstIA">a video</a> about camera assignments at professional baseball games and I had fun finding the camera operators at high first, low first, and center field. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1280" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0078-1920x1280.webp" alt="Two camera operators stand on a fenced-in platform above the center-field wall and point their cameras at the pitcher and batter." class="wp-image-460" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0078-1920x1280.webp 1920w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0078-800x533.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0078-768x512.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0078-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0078-2048x1365.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The camera operators at center field are responsible for filming each pitch.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I was walking around the concourse when the Mariners&#8217; Ty France <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/sporty-videos?playId=1f0dcd65-76bb-4a00-80fe-4e920e376a91">hit a home run</a>. While the crowed erupted in cheers, I was excited for a different reason — I was in the perfect position to watch the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable-suspended_camera_system">cable-suspended camera</a> move into position behind third base and film the runner crossing home plate!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1080" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0098-1920x1080.webp" alt="A mobile camera hanging from a pair of cables follows a Seattle Mariners baseball player jogging towards third base." class="wp-image-461" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0098-1920x1080.webp 1920w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0098-800x450.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0098-768x432.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0098-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0098-2048x1152.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The cable operated camera follows the batter along the third base line after a home run.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Random people keep the ball rolling</h2>



<p>To me, no sport is as compelling as all the logistics and anonymous work that goes on behind the scenes. For example, T-Mobile Park still has an analog scoreboard in addition to all the digital ones, which means someone has to be in charge of updating it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1280" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0091-1920x1280.webp" alt="A young, bored-looking person sits on a chair and rests their arms on the stadium scoreboard." class="wp-image-468" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0091-1920x1280.webp 1920w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0091-800x533.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0091-768x512.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0091-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0091-2048x1365.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<p>Every time a player gets on base, their team&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batboy">batboy</a> runs out to pick up their discarded bat and help switch their gloves. The home team&#8217;s batboy is also responsible for refilling the umpire&#8217;s stock of extra balls, which happens a lot — MLB teams go through <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/3325753/2022/05/26/guardians-tigers-baseballs-used/">about a hundred balls</a> in a game!</p>

<p>The most exciting piece of logistics came between innings, when an army of men with rakes came out to smooth the base paths.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1080" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0067-1920x1080.webp" alt="People with large rakes smooth out the dirt between first and second base." class="wp-image-459" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0067-1920x1080.webp 1920w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0067-800x450.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0067-768x432.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0067-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0067-2048x1152.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Take me out to the ball game?</h2>



<p>I&#8217;m never going to be a person who regularly attends live sports: it&#8217;s too crowded, too noisy, and I don&#8217;t care enough about the action happening on the field. But I&#8217;m really glad to have gone once. It was a lot of fun to explore the stadium and see a few glimpses of what goes in to putting on a baseball game. Thanks Microsoft for bringing me to a fun event! </p>

<p>A while ago I arbitrarily decided that I needed a favourite three-digit number (don’t ask) and ended up choosing 216. It’s a nice cube number —&nbsp;6×6×6&nbsp;— and can also be expressed as a sum of three smaller cubes:</p>



<div class="wp-block-katex-display-block katex-eq" data-katex-display="true"><pre>6^3 = 5^3 + 4^3 + 3^3</pre></div>



<span id="more-163"></span>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/216_(number)">Wikipedia article for the number</a>&nbsp;has&nbsp;<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Plato_number.svg">a diagram</a>&nbsp;showing one way to reassemble a 6×6×6 cube into three smaller cubes, but I’ve been playing around looking for other, more aesthetically pleasing methods. Here’s one I found.</p>



<p>First, we break the 6×6×6 cube into its 4×4×4 interior, six 4×4×1 faces, twelve 4×1×1 edges, and eight 1×1×1 corners<sup data-fn="3dde39ee-627c-411e-9090-1effecda7ff5" class="fn"><a href="#3dde39ee-627c-411e-9090-1effecda7ff5" id="3dde39ee-627c-411e-9090-1effecda7ff5-link">1</a></sup>: i.e.,</p>



<div class="wp-block-katex-display-block katex-eq" data-katex-display="true"><pre>6^3 = 4^3 + 6\cdot 4^2 + 12\cdot 4^1 + 8 \cdot 4^0</pre></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/216.svg" alt="An exploded-view diagram of a cube separated into an interior, faces, edges, and corners." class="wp-image-208"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Decomposing the cube according to its polytope boundaries.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The 4×4×1 faces can be combined with seven of the edges and one of the corners to build a 5×5×5 cube. The remaining five edges can be split into ten 2×1×1 chunks and arranged with the remaining seven corners to form a 3×3×3 cube.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rearrange.svg" alt="An exploded-view diagram of a 3×3×3 cube and a 5×5×5 cube using the pieces of the 6×6×6 cube from before." class="wp-image-209"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Rearranging the pieces into smaller cubes.</figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cubes.svg" alt="The unexploded view of the 3×3×3, 4×4×4, and 5×5×5 cubes made from the pieces of the 6×6×6 cube." class="wp-image-210"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The final three cubes.</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are many more ways to construct three cubes from the pieces of a 6×6×6 cube. What’s your favourite?</p>

<p>Today I learned the reason why Vancouver has two impressive-looking historic train stations: they were built by two different companies to serve as the terminus of two different railways.</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfront_station_(Vancouver)">Waterfront station</a> was built in 1914 for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Pacific_Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a>, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Central_Station">Pacific Central Station</a> was built a few years later for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Northern_Railway">Canadian Northern Railway</a>.<sup data-fn="93b38774-a02a-411e-b8a5-c0dc9674c4e5" class="fn"><a href="#93b38774-a02a-411e-b8a5-c0dc9674c4e5" id="93b38774-a02a-411e-b8a5-c0dc9674c4e5-link">1</a></sup></p>



<p>Anyways, neither station is currently used by the company that built it, with Waterfront Station serving as the regional public transit hub and Pacific Central Station used by Via Rail, Amtrak, and various intercity bus companies.</p>

<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> calls your attention to the sky… but there’s more weird stuff up there than just the floating islands.</p>



<span id="more-153"></span>



<p>If you look into Hyrule’s sky at night, you’ll see the <strong>stars do not move</strong> while the moon races from one horizon to the other.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/moon.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The moon moves across a fixed starfield.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This means that the cosmology of the <em>Zelda</em> universe is significantly different from our own; if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_Revolution">Copernicus</a> was Hylian he’d have stuck with a geocentric model.<sup data-fn="2c82e157-3611-45f1-a3f1-1f56bc34e73b" class="fn"><a href="#2c82e157-3611-45f1-a3f1-1f56bc34e73b" id="2c82e157-3611-45f1-a3f1-1f56bc34e73b-link">1</a></sup></p>



<p>That’s not the only astronomical oddity in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. <strong>The sun’s position at sunrise and sunset doesn’t make sense</strong>. On Earth, the sun doesn’t always rise and set <em>exactly</em> in the east and west. In the (boreal) summer, the sun rises and sets further north, providing us in the Northern Hemisphere with more hours of sunlight each day.</p>



<p>Here in the Vancouver summer, the sun currently rises 38° north of east and sets 38° north of west. In <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> the sun rises around 4:00 and sets around 9:00,<sup data-fn="9c229a3c-bc95-4c91-90c6-3cc9a8526925" class="fn"><a href="#9c229a3c-bc95-4c91-90c6-3cc9a8526925" id="9c229a3c-bc95-4c91-90c6-3cc9a8526925-link">2</a></sup> so you’d expect them to happen at similar angles instead of due east and west.</p>



<p>This is more evidence towards a geocentric model of Hylian cosmology, since the day-night cycle can be explained if the sun’s orbit around the world intersects Hyrule but its center does not.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/24hours.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A 24-hour cycle of sunrise and moonrise.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The strangest phenomenon I noticed is the fact that <strong>moon only appears at night</strong>. Sure, we culturally associate the moon with night, but in reality it’s out during the day half the time. This is what gives the moon <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/moon/moon-phases/">its phases</a>; the closer the moon is to the sun in the sky, the less of it appears illuminated to us on Earth. If the moon always rises and sets at the same time of day, its phases cannot be explained as the reflected light of the sun!</p>



<p>The simplest explanation would be that Link is observing the rotation of a moon with one luminescent side, but I looked closely and the half-moon has the same face as the full moon. This means that, like Earth’s moon, the Hylian moon is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking">tidally locked</a><sup data-fn="413f2cee-ede6-45ee-a0fe-4e09834d120a" class="fn"><a href="#413f2cee-ede6-45ee-a0fe-4e09834d120a" id="413f2cee-ede6-45ee-a0fe-4e09834d120a-link">3</a></sup> and always shows the same face.</p>

<p>My best theory is that the moon is made of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence">fluorescent</a> material and is orbited by a small body that emits ultraviolet or other high-energy light in the non-visible spectrum. Do you have an alternative headcanon theory?</p>

<p>I recently went for a walk in təmtəmíxʷtən (Belcarra), and when I got to… wait, what’s that weird derelict building in the distance?</p>



<span id="more-151"></span>



<p>Is it an abandoned hotel? No, there’s no way to get there by land. An old naval fortress? No, the location doesn’t make any strategic sense. A hydroelectric dam? Where’s the water behind it?</p>



<p>As it turns out, it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a power plant!&nbsp;<a href="https://montecristomagazine.com/community/the-buntzen-lake-powerhouses">Buntzen generating station #2</a>, completed in 1914, was built to supplement the output of BC’s first-ever hydroelectric plant up-inlet. Both stations were powered by water delivered by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penstock">penstocks</a>&nbsp;from Buntzen Lake, which in turn was supplied with water from Coquitlam Lake via a 4km-long tunnel.</p>



<p>Buntzen station #1&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bchydro.com/energy-in-bc/operations/our-facilities/lower-mainland.html">is still functional</a>&nbsp;and supplies 60 megawatts of power to the Metro Vancouver area. Buntzen #2 was shut down at the turn of the millennium and serves as a historic curiosity for kayakers in səl̓ilw̓ət (Indian Arm).</p>

<p>Julius Caesar’s given name was Gaius. &#8220;Julius&#8221; and &#8220;Caesar&#8221; were both family names (Caesar being a branch of the Julia family).</p>



<p>In his time, he was referred to as&nbsp;<em>Gaius Caesar</em> or simply as <em>Caesar</em> by <a href="https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Commentarii_de_bello_Gallico">himself</a> and <a href="https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Pro_Marcello">his contemporaries</a>. Calling him &#8220;Julius Caesar&#8221; would have been redundant since every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julii_Caesares">Caesar</a> was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_gens">Julius</a>.</p>



<p>The Romans had a lot of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_naming_conventions">traditions</a>&nbsp;around names.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Julius_Caesar_(name)">Gaius Julius Caesar</a>&nbsp;inherited his name from his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.</p>



<p>Caesar’s great-nephew&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Gaius Octavius Thurinus</a>&nbsp;also took the name Gaius Julius Caesar when he inherited the assassinated dictator’s estate. To prevent confusion, he’s often called&nbsp;<em>Octavianus</em>, which is more or less the ancient Roman equivalent to &#8220;the artist formerly known as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)">Prince</a>&#8220;. The emperor&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula">Caligula</a>, Octavian’s great-grandson, was also named Gaius Caesar; we know him by a nickname he received as a small child.</p>

<p>Between cabbage, lettuce, maple, and holly, two plants are in the rosid clade (related to roses) and two are in the asterid clade (related to sunflowers). Can you guess which is which?</p>



<span id="more-143"></span>



<p>I would have guessed that the trees might be related to a woody rose bush, while the leafy greens would be closer to broad-leaved sunflowers. I would have been wrong. Plants are&nbsp;<em>much</em>&nbsp;weirder than that.</p>



<p>In fact, cabbages are much more closely related to maple trees than they are to lettuce;&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica_oleracea">cabbage</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple">maples</a>&nbsp;are both&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosids">rosids</a>. Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly">holly trees</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lettuce">lettuce</a>&nbsp;are both&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterids">asterids</a>.</p>



<p>As it turns out, a lot of the categories we use to think about plants — trees, bushes, berries, vegetables, and so on — are not particularly unique from an genetic perspective. Biologist Georgia Ray&nbsp;<a href="https://eukaryotewritesblog.com/2021/05/02/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-tree/">explains</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>On the evolutionary tree of plants, trees are regularly interspersed with things that are&nbsp;<em>absolutely, 100%</em>&nbsp;not trees. This means that, for instance:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The common ancestor of a maple and a mulberry tree was not a tree.</li>



<li>The common ancestor of a stinging nettle and a strawberry plant was a tree.</li>



<li>And this is true for most trees or non-trees that you can think of.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>Because of this, there are plenty of plant lists you can play &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_of_These_Things_(Is_Not_Like_the_Others)">One of these things is not like the others</a>&#8221;&nbsp;with where the intuitive answer is very different from the phylogenetic answer.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Blackberries, strawberries, blueberries, apples.<sup data-fn="8579fd8e-f816-42eb-9c6d-132cbaa16b4d" class="fn"><a href="#8579fd8e-f816-42eb-9c6d-132cbaa16b4d" id="8579fd8e-f816-42eb-9c6d-132cbaa16b4d-link">1</a></sup></li>



<li>Almonds, walnuts, brazil nuts,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia_arnoldii">stinking corpse flower</a>.<sup data-fn="cdd77cc9-5d26-4444-83ed-c2092bda8ae9" class="fn"><a href="#cdd77cc9-5d26-4444-83ed-c2092bda8ae9" id="cdd77cc9-5d26-4444-83ed-c2092bda8ae9-link">2</a></sup></li>



<li>Palm tree, papaya tree, banana tree, asparagus.<sup data-fn="07e127b5-7900-4fc1-9d53-7f9cce460ad9" class="fn"><a href="#07e127b5-7900-4fc1-9d53-7f9cce460ad9" id="07e127b5-7900-4fc1-9d53-7f9cce460ad9-link">3</a></sup></li>

<p>Trees are not a family, they’re a strategy.</p>

<p>Wood is a strategy. Fruit is a strategy. A&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Such_Thing_as_a_Fish#Title">fish</a>&nbsp;is also a strategy.</p>

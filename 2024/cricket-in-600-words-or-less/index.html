<p>Here’s everything you need to know to enjoy a cricket match in 600 words or less.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Cricket is played on an oval field with a rectangular pitch in the middle. Two players on the batting team stand on either side of the pitch; the eleven players on the fielding team take up positions around the field.</p>
<astro-figure> <figure> <a href="/_astro/oval.Dji7e-zB_ZPknQs.webp" data-pswp-width="1600" data-pswp-height="713"> <img src="/_astro/oval.Dji7e-zB_ZPknQs.webp" srcset="/_astro/oval.Dji7e-zB_IiNq4.webp 640w, /_astro/oval.Dji7e-zB_10euwx.webp 1024w, /_astro/oval.Dji7e-zB_ZPknQs.webp 1600w" alt="A wide angle of a cricket match in progress (English Cricket Board)" width="1600" height="713" loading="lazy" decoding="async"> </a> <figcaption><p>This wide angle shows nine of the England fielders in red (two are out of
frame to the right), two New Zealand batters in black, and two umpires.</p></figcaption> </figure> </astro-figure> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Figure.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.Czo8c06S.js"></script>
<h2 id="runs">Runs</h2>
<p>The cricket ball is bowled overarm by a player on the fielding team and can bounce once. The batter hits the ball and switches ends with the other batter, scoring one run each time this happens.</p>
<figure> <video src="/_astro/Delivery.DK-uGTsS.mp4" controls loop muted></video> <figcaption><p>A typical delivery is bowled and hit for a single run. The batter can choose
not to run if they don’t think they’ll make it in time.</p></figcaption> </figure>
<p>If the batter hits the ball all the way to the boundary of the field, they score four runs automatically.</p>
<figure> <video src="/_astro/Boundary%20-%20Four.Dm97_Ik9.mp4" controls loop muted></video> <figcaption></figcaption> </figure>
<p>If they hit the ball really hard over the boundary, they score six runs.</p>
<figure> <video src="/_astro/Boundary%20-%20Six.DWqS7Btq.mp4" controls loop muted></video> <figcaption><p>A ball hit into the stands is worth six runs — but the crowd has to give it
back so the same ball can be used for the whole innings.</p></figcaption> </figure>
<h2 id="wickets">Wickets</h2>
<p>The goal of the fielding team is to get the batters out (“take their wickets”) before they score lots of runs.</p>
<p>The batter is <strong>out caught</strong> if they hit the ball and a fielder catches it before it hits the ground.</p>
<figure> <video src="/_astro/Wicket%20-%20Caught.BlNCXM7s.mp4" controls loop muted></video> <figcaption><p>Out caught is the most common form of dismissal in cricket.</p></figcaption> </figure>
<p>The batter is <strong>out bowled</strong> if they miss and the ball hits the wicket behind them.</p>
<figure> <video src="/_astro/Wicket%20-%20Bowled.DEPlypmg.mp4" controls loop muted></video> <figcaption><p>Some games have fancy stumps and bails that light up when the wicket is
broken.</p></figcaption> </figure>
<p>The batter is <strong>out leg before wicket</strong> if they use their body to block the ball from hitting the wicket.</p>
<figure> <video src="/_astro/Wicket%20-%20LBW.BIBOsZt4.mp4" controls loop muted></video> <figcaption><p>A batter is out LBW if the ball would have gone on to hit the wicket after
hitting their body. Ball-tracking technology is used to judge LBW appeals that
are sent to the third umpire.</p></figcaption> </figure>
<p>The batter is <strong>run out</strong> if they run and the fielding side breaks the wicket before they’re safe.</p>
<figure> <video src="/_astro/Wicket%20-%20Run%20out.HKNE59_I.mp4" controls loop muted></video> <figcaption><p>To be safe, the batter’s bat or body must be touching the ground behind the
white line. In this case, the batter is out because she didn’t quite get her
bat grounded in time.</p></figcaption> </figure>
<p>The batter is <strong>out stumped</strong> if they come too far out, miss the ball, and get run out by the wicketkeeper.</p>
<figure> <video src="/_astro/Wicket%20-%20Stumped.It3jsGUE.mp4" controls loop muted></video> <figcaption><p>The wicketkeeper may stand close to the wicket for slower balls to make it
easier to effect a stumping.</p></figcaption> </figure>
<h2 id="overs">Overs</h2>
<p>Every six balls, the fielders switch ends and a different player from the fielding team comes on to bowl. Six balls is also called an <strong>over</strong>.<sup id="fnref:1" class="astro-ogpmuyat"><a class="fn-ref astro-ogpmuyat" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> </p>
<p>Each team gets to bat for 20 overs<sup id="fnref:2" class="astro-ogpmuyat"><a class="fn-ref astro-ogpmuyat" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>  or until they have lost ten wickets. Whichever team has the most runs after both sides bat wins.</p>
<h2 id="extras">Extras</h2>
<p>There are a bunch of rules that govern how the ball should be bowled. A violation results in a do-over, except the batting team is awarded an extra run and gets to keep any runs they scored off the illegal delivery.</p>
<p>A <strong>wide</strong> is signalled if the umpire judges that the ball was bowled too wide or too high for it to be reasonably hit.</p>
<figure> <video src="/_astro/Extra%20-%20Wide.Beg-q3-0.mp4" controls loop muted></video> <figcaption><p>The umpire signals a wide by stretching their arms out.</p></figcaption> </figure>
<p>A <strong>no ball</strong> is signalled if the delivery is illegal for another reason, usually because the bowler stepped too far over the white line.</p>
<figure> <video src="/_astro/Extra%20-%20No%20ball.-Ed2ROtZ.mp4" controls loop muted></video> <figcaption><p>If the bowler’s front foot lands entirely on or over the white line, the
delivery is a no ball.</p></figcaption> </figure>
<p>A batter cannot be dismissed for being caught, bowled, stumped, or LBW off a no-ball. Depending on the competition, the batter may be awarded the same immunities for the next ball as well — this is called a “free hit”.</p>
<h2 id="positions">Positions</h2>
<p>A typical team roster has some specialist <strong>batters</strong> who usually don’t bowl, some specialist <strong>bowlers</strong> who aren’t expected to get lots of runs, and some <strong>all-rounders</strong> who are good at both batting and bowling.</p>
<p>There are two main bowling styles: <strong>fast bowlers</strong> rely on the speed of their deliveries while <strong>spin bowlers</strong> deliver slow but tricky balls.</p>
<p>Each team has a <strong>wicketkeeper</strong> who stops the balls that get past the batter. You can recognize the wicketkeeper as the only fielder who wears gloves.</p>
<p>Fielders can be deployed anywhere, subject to a few restrictions.<sup id="fnref:3" class="astro-ogpmuyat"><a class="fn-ref astro-ogpmuyat" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> . Commentators describe fielding positions using funny names like slip, gully, mid-off, square leg, and third man.</p>
<h2 id="scoreboard">Scoreboard</h2>
<p>A typical TV broadcast overlay displays the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The batting team’s current run total and wickets lost.<sup id="fnref:4" class="astro-ogpmuyat"><a class="fn-ref astro-ogpmuyat" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> </li>
<li>The number of overs completed or the number of balls remaining.</li>
<li>The current batters’ names, runs scored, and balls faced, with some indication of which batter is facing the next ball.</li>
<li>The current bowler.</li>
</ul>

23 runs off 10 balls. The current bowler is New Zealand’s Kasperek, who has

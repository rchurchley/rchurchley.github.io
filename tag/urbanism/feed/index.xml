<p>This picture illustrates the danger of poorly-designed streets, which the Swedish government set out to improve in the 1990s. It was originally created by Swedish artist <a href="http://www.jilg.com/">Karl Jilg</a>, who was commissioned by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Road_Administration">Swedish Road Administration</a> to explain new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_Zero">Vision Zero</a> initiatives.</p>



<span id="more-132"></span>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-23176-7_8-1">ideas</a>&nbsp;behind the initiatives were that</p>



<ol>
<li>The responsibility for preventing deaths and injuries on the road transportation system partly rests with the people who design that infrastructure, and</li>



<li>Deaths and injuries on the road ultimately come down to kinetic energy.</li>
</ol>



<p>The picture is intended to turn the kinetic energy of a moving car into a height to show the consequences of simple human mistakes in the road system. Research shows that the highest acceptable speed on a street with active users like this is 30km/h.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="600" height="800" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jilg-sidewalk-jpeg.webp" alt="An illustration of a city block with bottomless pits for streets." class="wp-image-227" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jilg-sidewalk-jpeg.webp 600w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jilg-sidewalk-450x600.webp 450w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Pedestrians navigate the dangerous chasms of city streets. (Karl Jilg / Vägverket)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The image has been widely shared, thanks in part to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/11/18/7236471/cars-pedestrians-sidewalks-roads">a 2014 Vox article</a>&nbsp;that used it to call attention to other pedestrian-hostile aspects about many cities’ street designs:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Most roads in the US are built for cars, not for pedestrians. This brilliant illustration shows just how lopsided the the proportions of a normal urban street corner really are.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The city sidewalk picture is just one of a series of four that Jilg illustrated for the Swedish government. The other one I found is set on a highway.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="600" height="800" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jilg-canyon-jpeg.webp" alt="An illustration of a car speeding along a road high in the mountains." class="wp-image-228" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jilg-canyon-jpeg.webp 600w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jilg-canyon-450x600.webp 450w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A car moving at highway speeds has a lot of kinetic energy. (Karl Jilg / Vägverket)</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’m not sure whether Jilg did any calculations to create these, but a head-on collision between two cars at highway speed is approximately equivalent to a single car being dropped from a height of 200m. Sweden added median barriers to many highways in the late ’90s, which reduced the incidence of head-on collisions and the risk of fatalities by 80%.</p>



<p>I have unfortunately not been able to find the other two illustrations in the set. Jilg has, however, done other work for the Swedish government.</p>

<p>While doing research for the game, Librande was faced with quantifying our land use decisions.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>When I started measuring out our local grocery store, which I don’t think of as being that big, I was blown away by how much more space was parking lot rather than actual store.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For example, here in Vancouver the&nbsp;<a href="https://vancouver.ca/your-government/parking-bylaw.aspx">parking bylaw</a>&nbsp;requires one 14m² parking space for every 20m² of supermarket floor space. Adding the necessary lanes to allow cars to get in and out, this law practically guarantees that grocery stores will be more parking lot than store.</p>

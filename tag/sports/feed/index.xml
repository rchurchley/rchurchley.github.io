<p>Cricket has a bit of a reputation for being hard to understand, but it&#8217;s actually a simpler game than the most popular North American sports.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s everything you need to know to enjoy a cricket match in 600 words or less.</p>



<span id="more-482"></span>



<p>Cricket is played on an oval field with a rectangular pitch in the middle. Two players on the batting team stand on either side of the pitch; the eleven players on the fielding team take up positions around the field.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1600" height="713" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/oval-jpg.webp" alt="A wide angle of a cricket match in progress." class="wp-image-487" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/oval-jpg.webp 1600w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/oval-800x357.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/oval-768x342.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/oval-1536x684.webp 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This wide angle shows nine of the England fielders in red (two are out of frame to the right), two New Zealand batters in black, and two umpires.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Runs</h2>



<p>The cricket ball is bowled overarm by a player on the fielding team and can bounce once. The batter hits the ball and switches ends with the other batter, scoring one run each time this happens.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Delivery.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A typical delivery is bowled and hit for a single run. The batter can choose not to run if they don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll make it in time.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If the batter hits the ball all the way to the boundary of the field, they score four runs automatically.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Boundary-Four.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>If they hit the ball really hard over the boundary, they score six runs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Boundary-Six.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A ball hit into the stands is worth six runs — but the crowd has to give it back so the same ball can be used for the whole innings.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wickets</h2>



<p>The goal of the fielding team is to get the batters out (&#8220;take their wickets&#8221;) before they score lots of runs.</p>



<p>The batter is <strong>out caught</strong> if they hit the ball and a fielder catches it before it hits the ground.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wicket-Caught.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Out caught is the most common form of dismissal in cricket.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The batter is <strong>out bowled</strong> if they miss and the ball hits the wicket behind them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wicket-Bowled.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Some games have fancy stumps and bails that light up when the wicket is broken.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The batter is <strong>out leg before wicket</strong> if they use their body to block the ball from hitting the wicket.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wicket-LBW.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A batter is out LBW if the ball hits their body and would have gone on to hit the wicket.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The batter is <strong>run out</strong> if they run and the fielding side breaks the wicket before they&#8217;re safe.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wicket-Run-out.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">To be safe, the batter&#8217;s body or bat must be touching the ground behind the white line.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The batter is <strong>out stumped</strong> if they come too far out, miss the ball, and get run out by the wicketkeeper.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wicket-Stumped.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The wicketkeeper stumps the batter by breaking the wicket with the ball or their hand holding the ball.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overs</h2>



<p>Every six balls<sup data-fn="99fed2f4-c6f7-45ae-9262-1e7a4f82165b" class="fn"><a href="#99fed2f4-c6f7-45ae-9262-1e7a4f82165b" id="99fed2f4-c6f7-45ae-9262-1e7a4f82165b-link">1</a></sup>, the fielders switch ends and a different player from the fielding team comes on to bowl. Six balls is also called an <strong>over</strong>.</p>



<p>Each team gets to bat for 20 overs<sup data-fn="99ce75d3-e31e-4847-9632-c32296b65a09" class="fn"><a href="#99ce75d3-e31e-4847-9632-c32296b65a09" id="99ce75d3-e31e-4847-9632-c32296b65a09-link">2</a></sup> or until they have lost ten wickets. Whichever team has the most runs after both sides bat wins.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Extras</h2>



<p>There are a bunch of rules that govern how the ball should be bowled. A violation results in a do-over, except the batting team is awarded an extra run and gets to keep any runs they scored off the illegal delivery.</p>



<p>A <strong>wide</strong> is signalled if the umpire judges that the ball was bowled too wide or too high for it to be reasonably hit.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Extra-Wide.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The umpire signals a wide by stretching their arms out.</figcaption></figure>



<p>A <strong>no ball</strong> is signalled if the bowler steps too far over the white line while bowling.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop muted preload="auto" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/No-ball.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Overstepping is the most common way a no ball is called against a bowler.</figcaption></figure>



<p>A no ball also turns the next ball into a &#8220;free hit&#8221;, meaning the batter is immune from getting out caught, bowled, stumped, or LBW off that ball.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Positions</h2>



<p>A typical team roster has some specialist <strong>batters</strong> who usually don&#8217;t bowl, some specialist <strong>bowlers</strong> who aren&#8217;t expected to get lots of runs, and some <strong>all-rounders</strong> who are good at both batting and bowling.</p>



<p>There are two main bowling styles: <strong>fast bowlers</strong> rely on the speed of their deliveries while <strong>spin bowlers</strong> deliver slow but tricky balls.</p>



<p>Each team has a <strong>wicketkeeper</strong> who stops the balls that get past the batter. You can recognize the wicketkeeper as the only fielder who wears gloves.</p>



<p>Fielders can be deployed anywhere, subject to a few restrictions.<sup data-fn="1d6b6fa8-d61b-403f-b70b-2587dd8c9711" class="fn"><a href="#1d6b6fa8-d61b-403f-b70b-2587dd8c9711" id="1d6b6fa8-d61b-403f-b70b-2587dd8c9711-link">3</a></sup> Commentators describe fielding positions using funny names like slip, gully, mid-off, square leg, and third man. You don&#8217;t need to memorize these.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Scoreboard</h2>



<p>A typical TV broadcast overlay displays the following information:</p>



<ul>
<li>The batting team&#8217;s current run total and wickets lost.<sup data-fn="c2ccf6cd-bb84-4278-a55f-12365bf3377f" class="fn"><a href="#c2ccf6cd-bb84-4278-a55f-12365bf3377f" id="c2ccf6cd-bb84-4278-a55f-12365bf3377f-link">4</a></sup></li>



<li>The number of overs completed or the number of balls remaining.</li>



<li>The<strong> </strong>current batters&#8217; names, runs scored, and balls faced, with some indication of which batter is facing the next ball.</li>



<li>The current bowler.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1600" height="900" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/scoreline-jpg.webp" alt="A cricket TV broadcast. The overlay reads as follows: ENG 101-2. 12/20. Run Rate 8.42. Beaumont 47* (39), Jones 23 (10). NZ Kasperek 1-24 (2)." class="wp-image-492" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/scoreline-jpg.webp 1600w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/scoreline-800x450.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/scoreline-768x432.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/scoreline-1536x864.webp 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This overlay indicates that England are batting and have scored 101 runs for the loss of 2 wickets. It is the 12th over in a 20-over match. Beaumont has scored 47 runs off 39 balls and is facing the current ball. Jones has scored 23 runs off 10 balls. The current bowler is New Zealand&#8217;s Kasperek, who has taken 1 wicket and given up 24 runs in 2 overs this match.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When the first team is batting, the overlay may show the current <strong>run rate</strong> (average runs per over).</p>



<p>When the second team is batting, the overlay shows either the <strong>target score</strong> needed to win, or the remaining runs needed to reach the target.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>That&#8217;s all you need to follow and enjoy a cricket match! All that&#8217;s left to learn is a few bits of jargon, the names of the players, and the details of whatever tournament or competition you want to follow. You&#8217;ll pick up all of those as you go.</p>



<p>Some tournaments worth following are:</p>



<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup">Men&#8217;s Twenty20 World Cup</a> (this June).</li>



<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Women%27s_T20_World_Cup">Women&#8217;s Twenty20 World Cup</a> (this October). </li>



<li>England&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehundred.com/">The Hundred</a> (August).</li>



<li>Australia&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cricket.com.au/big-bash">Big Bash League</a> (December–January).</li>



<li>India&#8217;s <a href="https://www.iplt20.com/">IPL</a> (April–May) and <a href="https://www.wplt20.com/">WPL</a> (March).</li>
</ul>



<p>National sides often play <a href="https://www.icc-cricket.com/fixtures-results">series against each other</a> as well.</p>



<p>If you want to watch cricket, most series are carried in Canada by subscription streaming service <a href="https://www.willow.tv/">Willow TV</a>. You can also follow live text summaries and scorecards on sites like <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/">ESPN Cricinfo</a>.</p>

<p>I recently attended a Seattle Mariners game as part of a Microsoft event. It was my first time at a baseball game, so I recorded a bunch of observations about the experience.</p>



<span id="more-457"></span>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The stadium experience</h2>



<p>This was my first time attending any professional sport in person, so I didn&#8217;t have any idea what to expect. I checked the <a href="https://www.mlb.com/mariners/ballpark/information/guide">stadium rules</a> in advance and found I could bring my camera, but not my camera bag or any of my larger lenses. Fortunately, my wide-angle lens and 20–55mm kit lens — both barely within the regulations — were enough to get some interesting photos.</p>



<p>A big part of the ballpark experience is being able to wander around the stadium; I spent at least half the game exploring rather than sitting in my assigned seat. There&#8217;s a lot to look at and do in the stadium, and as long as you&#8217;re not blocking anyone&#8217;s view during an at-bat, there&#8217;s remarkable freedom to walk around the aisles and see the field from different angles.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Baseball is complicated</h2>



<p>Many of the Microsoft employees at the game — including myself — are more familiar with cricket than with baseball. Cricket has a reputation in North America for being hard to understand, but when I compare my <a href="https://rosschurchley.com/2024/cricket-in-600-words-or-less/">beginner&#8217;s guide to cricket</a> with our deliberations our section had to understand what was going on, I realized that baseball is <em>much</em> more complicated.</p>

<details class="wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow"><summary>Can you decipher these scoreboards?</summary>
<p>The bottom of the screen is the easiest to understand. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_zone">Balls, strikes</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)">outs</a> are fundamental to the game and relatively easy to explain to a newcomer<sup data-fn="d2bd537f-6e0d-41e2-aeaa-ec28deb4b285" class="fn"><a href="#d2bd537f-6e0d-41e2-aeaa-ec28deb4b285" id="d2bd537f-6e0d-41e2-aeaa-ec28deb4b285-link">1</a></sup>. Each team&#8217;s current score is the total number of runs under the &#8220;R&#8221; column; columns 1–9 show how many runs were scored in each inning. The &#8220;H&#8221; column counts the number of hits resulting on a runner on base due to the batting team&#8217;s efforts; the &#8220;E&#8221; column counts the number of errors by the fielding team that allowed their opponent to get a runner on base. I had no idea what the acronym &#8220;MVR&#8221; stood for until a colleague expanded it to &#8220;mound visits remaining&#8221;; this refers to a kind of time out the fielding team can take to discuss strategy or switch pitchers.</p>



<p>The sides of the scoreboard display the current lineup of each team with jersey numbers and positions; the highlighted name tells you whose turn it is to bat. The batting lineup shows one other piece of information for each player:</p>



<ul>
<li>For players that have not yet batted in the inning, it shows the batting average.</li>



<li>For players that have batted already in the inning, it shows a <a href="https://www.mlb.com/glossary/miscellaneous/scorekeeping">cryptic acronym</a> that tells you the result of their at-bat.</li>



<li>For pitchers (who do not bat), I think it shows the pitcher&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average">earned runs average</a> (ERA) which is its own whole thing.</li>
</ul>



<p>On this scoreboard, we see that Seattle&#8217;s Dominic Canzone, who wears number 8 on his jersey, plays left field and is currently up to bat. His batting average is .219.</p>



<p>Three Seattle players have already batted this inning. Center fielder Raleigh had a single (1B), as did right fielder Raley. First baseman France is listed as having a &#8220;P3&#8221; which is apparently the acronym for &#8220;out after hitting a pop fly which was caught by the first baseman.&#8221;</p>



<p>Finally, the middle of the first scoreboard shows the statistics of the current batter. I had to look up most of the stats <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_statistics">on Wikipedia</a>:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th>Abbr</th><th>Value</th><th>Stat</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>G</td><td>15</td><td>Games</td><td>Number of games the batter has played in this year.</td></tr><tr><td>AB</td><td>32</td><td>At-bats</td><td>Number of opportunities the batter had to bat, more or less, except that walks and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat">some other outcomes</a> don&#8217;t count towards this statistic.</td></tr><tr><td>2B</td><td>1</td><td>Doubles</td><td>Number of hits on which the batter was able to safely reach second base.</td></tr><tr><td>3B</td><td>0</td><td>Triples</td><td>Number of hits on which the batter was able to safely reach third base.</td></tr><tr><td>BB</td><td>3</td><td>Bases on balls</td><td>Number of times the batter was awarded first base after four called balls. (Better known as &#8220;walks&#8221;.)</td></tr><tr><td>SO</td><td>11</td><td>Strikeouts</td><td>Number of times the batter was called out after three strikes.</td></tr><tr><td>SB</td><td>0</td><td>Stolen bases</td><td>Number of times the player was able to steal a base. There are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base">bunch of rules</a> about when a runner can steal a base and when something is scored under this statistic.</td></tr><tr><td>CS</td><td>0</td><td>Caught stealing</td><td>Number of times the player was tagged out while attempting to steal a base.</td></tr><tr><td>AVG</td><td>.219</td><td>Batting average</td><td>Percentage of at-bats where the batter hit the ball and safely reached a base.</td></tr><tr><td>R</td><td>4</td><td>Runs</td><td>Number of times the batter scored a run by crossing home plate.</td></tr><tr><td>H</td><td>7</td><td>Hits</td><td>Number of times the batter hit the ball and safely reached a base.</td></tr><tr><td>HR</td><td>3</td><td>Home runs</td><td>Number of hits on which the batter was able to safely touch all three bases and cross home plate. (Usually by hitting the ball into the crowd.)</td></tr><tr><td>RBI</td><td>6</td><td>Runs batted in</td><td>Number of times the batter&#8217;s action allowed another player to score a run.</td></tr><tr><td>OBP</td><td>.286</td><td>On-base percentage</td><td>Percentage of the time the batter gets on base, including being awarded first base for a walk or being hit by a pitch.</td></tr><tr><td>SLG</td><td>.531</td><td>Slugging percentage</td><td>Average number of bases achieved per at-bat.</td></tr><tr><td>OPS</td><td>.817</td><td>On-base plus slugging</td><td>OBP plus SLG, for some reason.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Phew, we finally understand the scoreboard on the left! Now we just need to figure out what &#8220;FC, E5, No RBI&#8221; is supposed to mean. This was displayed on the jumbotron after the following play:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://sporty-clips.mlb.com/V3k0RDlfWGw0TUFRPT1fVndFQUJnSUVYMWNBRFFZQlhnQUFVQWRTQUZrSFYxQUFBbDBFQmxKVFVsQUVBUXBY.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>&#8220;FC&#8221; stands for &#8220;fielder&#8217;s choice&#8221;, meaning that the third baseman chose to try to get the out at third instead of throwing it to first. This means the hit doesn&#8217;t count towards the batter&#8217;s statistics. The &#8220;E5&#8221; means the scorer decided that the Seattle players were safe because of the third baseman&#8217;s error. Finally, the run that scored during the play does not count as an RBI for the batter because if it weren&#8217;t for the error, there would have been three outs and the runner wouldn&#8217;t have scored.</p>



<p>All of this is to say: baseball is <em>complicated</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Spot the camera</h2>



<p>Before I came to the game I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLU9C9rstIA">a video</a> about camera assignments at professional baseball games and I had fun finding the camera operators at high first, low first, and center field. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1280" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0078-1920x1280.webp" alt="Two camera operators stand on a fenced-in platform above the center-field wall and point their cameras at the pitcher and batter." class="wp-image-460" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0078-1920x1280.webp 1920w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0078-800x533.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0078-768x512.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0078-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0078-2048x1365.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The camera operators at center field are responsible for filming each pitch.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I was walking around the concourse when the Mariners&#8217; Ty France <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/sporty-videos?playId=1f0dcd65-76bb-4a00-80fe-4e920e376a91">hit a home run</a>. While the crowed erupted in cheers, I was excited for a different reason — I was in the perfect position to watch the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable-suspended_camera_system">cable-suspended camera</a> move into position behind third base and film the runner crossing home plate!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1080" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0098-1920x1080.webp" alt="A mobile camera hanging from a pair of cables follows a Seattle Mariners baseball player jogging towards third base." class="wp-image-461" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0098-1920x1080.webp 1920w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0098-800x450.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0098-768x432.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0098-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0098-2048x1152.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The cable operated camera follows the batter along the third base line after a home run.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Random people keep the ball rolling</h2>



<p>To me, no sport is as compelling as all the logistics and anonymous work that goes on behind the scenes. For example, T-Mobile Park still has an analog scoreboard in addition to all the digital ones, which means someone has to be in charge of updating it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1280" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0091-1920x1280.webp" alt="A young, bored-looking person sits on a chair and rests their arms on the stadium scoreboard." class="wp-image-468" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0091-1920x1280.webp 1920w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0091-800x533.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0091-768x512.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0091-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0091-2048x1365.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<p>Every time a player gets on base, their team&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batboy">batboy</a> runs out to pick up their discarded bat and help switch their gloves. The home team&#8217;s batboy is also responsible for refilling the umpire&#8217;s stock of extra balls, which happens a lot — MLB teams go through <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/3325753/2022/05/26/guardians-tigers-baseballs-used/">about a hundred balls</a> in a game!</p>

<p>The most exciting piece of logistics came between innings, when an army of men with rakes came out to smooth the base paths.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Take me out to the ball game?</h2>



<p>I&#8217;m never going to be a person who regularly attends live sports: it&#8217;s too crowded, too noisy, and I don&#8217;t care enough about the action happening on the field. But I&#8217;m really glad to have gone once. It was a lot of fun to explore the stadium and see a few glimpses of what goes in to putting on a baseball game. Thanks Microsoft for bringing me to a fun event! </p>

<ol class="wp-block-footnotes"><li id="d2bd537f-6e0d-41e2-aeaa-ec28deb4b285">Although even that explanation is not straightforward. &#8220;A strike is when the ball passes over the plate between the batter&#8217;s knees and shoulders and the batter doesn&#8217;t hit it; or if the batter swings and misses, regardless of where the ball is; or if the batter hits the ball behind the foul lines, except a foul ball doesn&#8217;t count for strike three.&#8221; <a href="#d2bd537f-6e0d-41e2-aeaa-ec28deb4b285-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote reference 1"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />︎</a></li></ol>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I love the dry humour in cricket commentary. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/wanderers-scrambles-to-find-plan-bee-1080873">This episode</a> describes what happened when bees swarmed the pitch in South Africa’s third ODI against Sri Lanka.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>At first they deployed a man with a stick. The groundsman approached one buzzing batch, decided his mode of attack would not work, and returned defeated.</p>



<p>Eventually a professional was summoned. One man lived out what must be the dreams of many aspiring beekeepers in South Africa, when he walked to the middle of a packed Wanderers stadium in his trademark baggy whites, nervelessly placed down his plastic box full of honeycomb, and masterfully opened up the lid. Before long he had ensnared his quarry, probably to wild cheers and fans offering to give him their numbers.</p>



<p>All up, the bees had spent about 65 minutes in the middle, which many noted, was more time than some Sri Lanka batsmen had managed.</p>

<p>Leah and I have really gotten into Magic: the Gathering. Our favourite ways to play are&nbsp;<a href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Sealed_Deck">sealed deck</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Jumpstart_(format)">Jumpstart</a>, both of which involve opening new packs and making decks out of what you open.</p>



<p>Since it would be wasteful (not to mention expensive) to buy new cards every time we play, we only buy a certain number of packs each set and re-use the cards we open to make our own packs for later games.</p>

<p>We originally tried coin envelopes and a product called&nbsp;<a href="https://hitpointpress.com/collections/thingamajigs">Cubeamajigs</a>, but neither was as nice or convenient as the side-loading papercraft boxes I made with my&nbsp;<a href="https://cricut.com/en-ca/">Cricut</a>.</p>



<p>The above SVG image can be imported into Cricut Design Space to make boxes of your own. Or, if you want to make a box with different dimensions, a tool called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.templatemaker.nl/en/cardbox/">Templatemaker</a>&nbsp;can make similar patterns.</p>

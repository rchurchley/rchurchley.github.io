<p>I recently went for a walk in təmtəmíxʷtən (Belcarra), and when I got to… wait, what’s that weird derelict building in the distance?</p>

<p>Is it an abandoned hotel? No, there’s no way to get there by land. An old naval fortress? No, the location doesn’t make any strategic sense. A hydroelectric dam? Where’s the water behind it?</p>



<p>As it turns out, it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a power plant!&nbsp;<a href="https://montecristomagazine.com/community/the-buntzen-lake-powerhouses">Buntzen generating station #2</a>, completed in 1914, was built to supplement the output of BC’s first-ever hydroelectric plant up-inlet. Both stations were powered by water delivered by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penstock">penstocks</a>&nbsp;from Buntzen Lake, which in turn was supplied with water from Coquitlam Lake via a 4km-long tunnel.</p>



<p>Buntzen station #1&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bchydro.com/energy-in-bc/operations/our-facilities/lower-mainland.html">is still functional</a>&nbsp;and supplies 60 megawatts of power to the Metro Vancouver area. Buntzen #2 was shut down at the turn of the millennium and serves as a historic curiosity for kayakers in səl̓ilw̓ət (Indian Arm).</p>

<p>Julius Caesar’s given name was Gaius. &#8220;Julius&#8221; and &#8220;Caesar&#8221; were both family names (Caesar being a branch of the Julia family).</p>



<p>In his time, he was referred to as&nbsp;<em>Gaius Caesar</em> or simply as <em>Caesar</em> by <a href="https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Commentarii_de_bello_Gallico">himself</a> and <a href="https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Pro_Marcello">his contemporaries</a>. Calling him &#8220;Julius Caesar&#8221; would have been redundant since every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julii_Caesares">Caesar</a> was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_gens">Julius</a>.</p>



<p>The Romans had a lot of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_naming_conventions">traditions</a>&nbsp;around names.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Julius_Caesar_(name)">Gaius Julius Caesar</a>&nbsp;inherited his name from his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.</p>



<p>Caesar’s great-nephew&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Gaius Octavius Thurinus</a>&nbsp;also took the name Gaius Julius Caesar when he inherited the assassinated dictator’s estate. To prevent confusion, he’s often called&nbsp;<em>Octavianus</em>, which is more or less the ancient Roman equivalent to &#8220;the artist formerly known as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)">Prince</a>&#8220;. The emperor&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula">Caligula</a>, Octavian’s great-grandson, was also named Gaius Caesar; we know him by a nickname he received as a small child.</p>

<p>In the late &#8217;60s, the government sought to adopt <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Canada"><em>O Canada</em></a> as the national anthem. The music and original French lyrics had passed into the public domain, but the English version was still under copyright. The government settled the rights <a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/o-canada">for a dollar</a>.</p>



<p>Ironically, the copyright to the English lyrics would have expired anyways by the time the <em>National Anthem Act</em> was finally passed in 1980.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem">Four-Colour Theorem</a>&nbsp;says that, no matter what the borders on your map are, you only need four colours to make sure that neighbouring regions are coloured differently. The theorem doesn’t apply if you let some regions claim other disconnected regions as their own, and in fact&nbsp;the map&nbsp;of European claims on Africa required five colours by the end of the 19th century.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Guthrie">Francis Guthrie</a>, who moved to the South African&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Colony">Cape Colony</a>&nbsp;in 1861, could well have owned a map like the above. Five colours are necessary to properly colour the land that Britain (red), France (orange), Portugal (yellow), Germany (green), and Belgium’s King Leopold II (purple) decided should belong to them.</p>



<p>Five territorities in the center are key to the map colouring:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Area</th><th>Colonizer</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f7e3.png" alt="🟣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></td><td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Basin">Congo basin</a></td><td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State">King Leopold II</a></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f7e0.png" alt="🟠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></td><td>north of the Congo</td><td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Congo">France</a></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f7e1.png" alt="🟡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></td><td>south of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwango_River">Kwango</a></td><td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_history_of_Angola">Portugal</a></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f534.png" alt="🔴" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></td><td>upper&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zambezi">Zambezi basin</a></td><td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_rule_in_Rhodesia">Britain</a></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f7e2.png" alt="🟢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></td><td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Great_Lakes">African Great Lakes</a></td><td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_East_Africa">Germany</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The boundaries between these colonies separate seven different pairs of empires. Borders between other African colonies account for the other three possible sets of neighbours:</p>



<ul>
<li>French Congo was next to German&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamerun">Kamerun</a>;</li>



<li>German East Africa to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Mozambique">Portuguese Mozambique</a>; and</li>



<li>French claims in the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubangi-Shari">Ubangi-Chari area</a>&nbsp;were next to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Egyptian_Sudan">Anglo-Egyption Sudan</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>In short, the adjacency graph between these empires was the complete graph&nbsp;<em>K<sub>5</sub>​</em>.</p>

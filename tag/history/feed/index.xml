<p>I recently went for a walk in təmtəmíxʷtən (Belcarra), and when I got to… wait, what’s that weird derelict building in the distance?</p>

<p>Is it an abandoned hotel? No, there’s no way to get there by land. An old naval fortress? No, the location doesn’t make any strategic sense. A hydroelectric dam? Where’s the water behind it?</p>



<p>As it turns out, it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a power plant!&nbsp;<a href="https://montecristomagazine.com/community/the-buntzen-lake-powerhouses">Buntzen generating station #2</a>, completed in 1914, was built to supplement the output of BC’s first-ever hydroelectric plant up-inlet. Both stations were powered by water delivered by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penstock">penstocks</a>&nbsp;from Buntzen Lake, which in turn was supplied with water from Coquitlam Lake via a 4km-long tunnel.</p>



<p>Buntzen station #1&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bchydro.com/energy-in-bc/operations/our-facilities/lower-mainland.html">is still functional</a>&nbsp;and supplies 60 megawatts of power to the Metro Vancouver area. Buntzen #2 was shut down at the turn of the millennium and serves as a historic curiosity for kayakers in səl̓ilw̓ət (Indian Arm).</p>

<p>Julius Caesar’s given name was Gaius. &#8220;Julius&#8221; and &#8220;Caesar&#8221; were both family names (Caesar being a branch of the Julia family).</p>



<p>In his time, he was referred to as&nbsp;<em>Gaius Caesar</em> or simply as <em>Caesar</em> by <a href="https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Commentarii_de_bello_Gallico">himself</a> and <a href="https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Pro_Marcello">his contemporaries</a>. Calling him &#8220;Julius Caesar&#8221; would have been redundant since every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julii_Caesares">Caesar</a> was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_gens">Julius</a>.</p>



<p>The Romans had a lot of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_naming_conventions">traditions</a>&nbsp;around names.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Julius_Caesar_(name)">Gaius Julius Caesar</a>&nbsp;inherited his name from his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.</p>



<p>Caesar’s great-nephew&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Gaius Octavius Thurinus</a>&nbsp;also took the name Gaius Julius Caesar when he inherited the assassinated dictator’s estate. To prevent confusion, he’s often called&nbsp;<em>Octavianus</em>, which is more or less the ancient Roman equivalent to &#8220;the artist formerly known as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)">Prince</a>&#8220;. The emperor&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula">Caligula</a>, Octavian’s great-grandson, was also named Gaius Caesar; we know him by a nickname he received as a small child.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Baker">Mount Baker</a> was named by George Vancouver after his third lieutenant, who was the first on his ship to see it.</p>



<p>Although the name is better than a few others in the Pacific Northwest, being the first person to see a giant mountain isn&#8217;t a particularly notable claim to fame. Especially when you have to ignore not only tens of thousands of people who lived there but also the Spaniards who had <a href="https://text-message.blogs.archives.gov/2017/10/12/225-years-ago-spanish-explorations-of-the-pacific-northwest-and-the-first-spanish-settlement-in-washington-state-nunez-gaona-neah-bay-1792-part-ii-spanish-explorations-of-the-pacific-northwest-a/">gotten there the year prior</a>.</p>

<p>The mountain appears as <em>la gran montaña del Carmelo</em> on <a href="https://doi.org/10.58066/a0dr-8a54">a map</a> drawn by Gonzalo Lopez de Haro, first pilot on Manuel Quimper’s six-week expedition to the Juan de Fuca strait. The Spanish name is apparently a reference to a religious order whose white cloaks resembled the snow-capped peak. Who knows, if the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootka_Crisis">Nootka Crisis</a> had been resolved differently, it&#8217;s entirely possible that Europeans would have ended up calling it Monte Carmelo.</p>



<p>Instead, the name Mount Baker stuck after Vancouver described it in his published memoir.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>About this time a very high conspicuous craggy mountain … presented itself, towering above the clouds: as low down as they allowed it to be visible it was covered with snow; and south of it, was a long ridge of very rugged snowy mountains, much less elevated, which seemed to stretch to a considerable distance … the high distant land formed, as already observed, like detached islands, amongst which the lofty mountain, discovered in the afternoon by the third lieutenant, and in compliment to him called by me Mount Baker, rose a very conspicuous object … apparently at a very remote distance.</p>
<cite><a href="https://archive.org/details/voyageofdiscover01vanc">George Vancouver</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Vancouver&#8217;s diary mentions encounters with different indigenous groups of the area, some friendly and some indifferent,<sup data-fn="0937946a-e2f5-41a5-a34d-1a7e0e7ece3c" class="fn"><a href="#0937946a-e2f5-41a5-a34d-1a7e0e7ece3c" id="0937946a-e2f5-41a5-a34d-1a7e0e7ece3c-link">1</a></sup> but he never stuck around in the same place long enough to learn their names or pick up their languages.<sup data-fn="a1b0c471-c99e-4b0f-96d6-d75194ae94e2" class="fn"><a href="#a1b0c471-c99e-4b0f-96d6-d75194ae94e2" id="a1b0c471-c99e-4b0f-96d6-d75194ae94e2-link">2</a></sup> If he had, he might have recognized Mount Baker by the name <em>kwelshan</em>, <a href="http://arcadianabe.blogspot.com/2012/12/koma-kulshan-mysterious-mountain-moniker.html">the term used</a> by the Lhaq&#8217;temish (Lummi) people around Bellingham and the San Juan Islands, or <em>swáʔlәx̣</em>, <a href="https://lingpapers.sites.olt.ubc.ca/#icsnl-xxxii-1997-25">reportedly used</a> by the nəxʷsƛ̕áy̕əm̕ (Klallam) people on the Olympic Peninsula.</p>



<p>The mountain itself is surrounded by the traditional lands of the Nooksack and Upper Skagit peoples. The Nooksack use <em>kwelshán</em> for the high open slopes of the mountain and <em>kweq’ smánit</em> for the glacier-covered summit.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem">Four-Colour Theorem</a>&nbsp;says that, no matter what the borders on your map are, you only need four colours to make sure that neighbouring regions are coloured differently. The theorem doesn’t apply if you let some regions claim other disconnected regions as their own, and in fact&nbsp;the map&nbsp;of European claims on Africa required five colours by the end of the 19th century.</p>

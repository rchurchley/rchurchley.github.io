<p><a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2016-02-29-land-use/index.html">Jens von Bergmann</a> has run the numbers on land use in various municipalities in Metro Vancouver. The City of Vancouver in particular has <em>lot</em> of land tied up in streets and detached housing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th>Use</th><th>CoV land</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>single-family detached houses and duplexes</td><td>34.0%</td></tr><tr><td>roads and right-of-way</td><td>28.1%</td></tr><tr><td>recreation, open space, and natural areas</td><td>15.2%</td></tr><tr><td>commercial</td><td>3.9%</td></tr><tr><td>low-rise apartments (residential or mixed-use)</td><td>4.1%</td></tr><tr><td>high-rise apartments (residential or mixed-use)</td><td>1.9%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Because the City of Vancouver has so little area left undeveloped, any proposals for new housing, schools, parks, stores, and so forth will displace some existing use of the land.</p>

<p>While doing research for the game, Librande was faced with quantifying our land use decisions.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>When I started measuring out our local grocery store, which I don’t think of as being that big, I was blown away by how much more space was parking lot rather than actual store.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For example, here in Vancouver the&nbsp;<a href="https://vancouver.ca/your-government/parking-bylaw.aspx">parking bylaw</a>&nbsp;requires one 14m² parking space for every 20m² of supermarket floor space. Adding the necessary lanes to allow cars to get in and out, this law practically guarantees that grocery stores will be more parking lot than store.</p>

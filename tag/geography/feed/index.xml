<p>It’s easy to confuse the flags of Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand if your eyes don’t know what to look for. </p>



<p>I had always distinguished between the two by the colour of the stars in the Southern Cross, but there’s a much easier way to tell them apart at lower resolution: AUS has a giant extra star in the lower left quadrant.</p>

<p>I’m on a quest to explore the creeks and waterways of Vancouver, Burnaby, and New Westminster. First, I need to understand how the topography of my neighbourhood determines the flow of water and the formation of streams.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1600" height="900" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/contours-jpeg.webp" alt="A topographic map of the Burrard Peninsula." class="wp-image-237" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/contours-jpeg.webp 1600w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/contours-800x450.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/contours-768x432.webp 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/contours-1536x864.webp 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A topographic map of the Burrard Peninsula.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Three main topological features define how water flows in the Vancouver-Burnaby-New West area:</p>



<ul>
<li>a chain of hills running along səl̓ilw̓ət (Burrard Inlet) from East Vancouver to Coquitlam, including Capitol Hill and lhuḵw’lkuḵw’áyten (Burnaby Mountain);</li>



<li>a ridge extending from t̕θəcəliʔqʷ (UBC) to sχʷeyəməɬ (New Westminster) along the southern half of the peninsula, with peaks at Little Mountain and the Metrotown area; and</li>



<li>weirdly enough, a barely perceptible incline between Nanaimo Street and Renfrew Street in East Vancouver.</li>
</ul>



<p>These features divide the Burrard Peninsula into four watersheds, which determine where a falling raindrop will flow</p>



<ul>
<li>north, into səl̓ilw̓ət (Burrard Inlet),</li>



<li>northwest, into False Creek/English Bay,</li>



<li>south, into stal̓əw̓ (the Fraser River), or</li>



<li>east, through Still Creek, Burnaby Lake, and the Brunette River, before returning west via stal̓əw̓ (the Fraser River).</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1600" height="900" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vancouver-watersheds.png" alt="A topographic map of the Burrard Peninsula, divided into four coloured regions as described above." class="wp-image-236" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vancouver-watersheds.png 1600w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vancouver-watersheds-800x450.png 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vancouver-watersheds-768x432.png 768w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vancouver-watersheds-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The main watersheds of the Burrard Peninsula.</figcaption></figure>



<p>(More detailed watershed maps can be found on the websites of the&nbsp;<a href="https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/one-water-watershed-characterization.pdf">City of Vancouver</a> and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.burnaby.ca/sites/default/files/acquiadam/2021-07/Waterways%20of%20Burnaby.pdf">City of Burnaby</a>.)</p>



<p>Most of the&nbsp;<a href="https://hdl.handle.net/11272/IKHNQ">historic streams</a>&nbsp;of Vancouver have been developed over, so rainwater now is mainly conveyed through storm drains and groundwater. In contrast, Burnaby still has plenty of streams carrying rain through its watersheds.</p>



<p>I’ll be exploring these streams and attempting to trace them from source to mouth. Stay tuned for more!</p>

<p>Shawn Mendes’ song “Lost in Japan” has had me geographically confused since I first heard it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zb_VFx3iyjg">covered by Scary Pockets</a>. If you haven’t listened to the lyrics, the song is about a person who is thinking about their crush and the possibility of taking a last-minute flight to Japan to see them. </p>



<p>The question I can’t get off my mind is: where is the song supposed to be taking place?</p>



<span id="more-124"></span>



<p>The chorus goes:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Do you got plans tonight?<br>I’m a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I<br>I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight<br>‘Cause I can’t get you off my mind</p>
</blockquote>



<p>from which we can infer that</p>



<ol>
<li>the crush is somewhere in Japan</li>



<li>the singer is outside of Japan, and</li>



<li>both people are close enough to an international airport for one to entertain the idea of flying to the other’s hotel.</li>
</ol>



<p>The most likely candidates for airports within “a couple hundred miles from Japan” are in South Korea.</p>

<p>When I first considered the geography of the song, I was satisfied with that answer: couple of hundred miles, South Korea, that sounds about right. But then I noticed the opening lyrics:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>All it’d take is one flight<br>We’d be in the same time zone</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That would seem to rule out South Korea, which is in the same time zone as Japan. With the closest locations out of the picture, we have to stretch our interpretation of the song. Here are the possibilities I can see.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-singer-could-be-in-shanghai">The singer could be in Shanghai</h2>



<p>Shanghai is 500 miles (in different directions) from Okinawa and Kyūshū Islands.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Pudong_International_Airport">Shanghai Pudong International Airport</a>&nbsp;was the eighth-busiest airport in the world when “Lost in Japan” was released, and has plenty of routes to both Naha and Nagasaki.</p>



<p>This is probably the most plausible answer if we make the thematically appropriate assumption that the lovestruck protagonist is downplaying the distance in order to convince themself that taking a last-minute flight is a good idea.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-singer-could-be-in-vladivostok">The singer could be in Vladivostok</h2>



<p>Vladivostok is also within 500 miles of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Chitose_Airport">New Chitose Airport</a>&nbsp;in Sapporo. This possibility is pretty funny, but unfortunately it’s ruled out by logistics. The only regular flight I could find between the two was only opened by Ural Airlines after “Lost in Japan” was released, and did not last long before world events shut it down permanently.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-singer-could-be-in-taipei">The singer could be in Taipei</h2>



<p>There’s only one location that geographically fits the lyrics exactly: our protagonist is in Taiwan, and their crush is less than 200 miles away in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishigaki,_Okinawa">Ishigaki</a>&nbsp;on Japan’s southwesternmost inhabited archipelago.</p>



<p>With a creative enough interpretation, this is also consistent with the second verse:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Do I gotta convince you<br>That you shouldn’t fall asleep?<br>It’ll only be a couple hours<br>And I’m about to leave.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The singer is presumably in a hurry to leave because they have just checked the timetable for the only direct flight from Taipei to Ishigaki, which runs on Wednesdays and Saturdays during the tourist season. The flight is short enough that “a couple hours” is realistic if customs is quick.</p>



<p>The line about falling asleep is, of course, a request for the romantic interest to skip their usual afternoon nap, since China Airlines flight 124 arrives at 11:35am.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Baker">Mount Baker</a> was named by George Vancouver after his third lieutenant, who was the first on his ship to see it.</p>



<p>Although the name is better than a few others in the Pacific Northwest, being the first person to see a giant mountain isn&#8217;t a particularly notable claim to fame. Especially when you have to ignore not only tens of thousands of people who lived there but also the Spaniards who had <a href="https://text-message.blogs.archives.gov/2017/10/12/225-years-ago-spanish-explorations-of-the-pacific-northwest-and-the-first-spanish-settlement-in-washington-state-nunez-gaona-neah-bay-1792-part-ii-spanish-explorations-of-the-pacific-northwest-a/">gotten there the year prior</a>.</p>

<p>The mountain appears as <em>la gran montaña del Carmelo</em> on <a href="https://doi.org/10.58066/a0dr-8a54">a map</a> drawn by Gonzalo Lopez de Haro, first pilot on Manuel Quimper’s six-week expedition to the Juan de Fuca strait. The Spanish name is apparently a reference to a religious order whose white cloaks resembled the snow-capped peak. Who knows, if the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootka_Crisis">Nootka Crisis</a> had been resolved differently, it&#8217;s entirely possible that Europeans would have ended up calling it Monte Carmelo.</p>



<p>Instead, the name Mount Baker stuck after Vancouver described it in his published memoir.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>About this time a very high conspicuous craggy mountain … presented itself, towering above the clouds: as low down as they allowed it to be visible it was covered with snow; and south of it, was a long ridge of very rugged snowy mountains, much less elevated, which seemed to stretch to a considerable distance … the high distant land formed, as already observed, like detached islands, amongst which the lofty mountain, discovered in the afternoon by the third lieutenant, and in compliment to him called by me Mount Baker, rose a very conspicuous object … apparently at a very remote distance.</p>

<p>Vancouver&#8217;s diary mentions encounters with different indigenous groups of the area, some friendly and some indifferent,<sup data-fn="0937946a-e2f5-41a5-a34d-1a7e0e7ece3c" class="fn"><a href="#0937946a-e2f5-41a5-a34d-1a7e0e7ece3c" id="0937946a-e2f5-41a5-a34d-1a7e0e7ece3c-link">1</a></sup> but he never stuck around in the same place long enough to learn their names or pick up their languages.<sup data-fn="a1b0c471-c99e-4b0f-96d6-d75194ae94e2" class="fn"><a href="#a1b0c471-c99e-4b0f-96d6-d75194ae94e2" id="a1b0c471-c99e-4b0f-96d6-d75194ae94e2-link">2</a></sup> If he had, he might have recognized Mount Baker by the name <em>kwelshan</em>, <a href="http://arcadianabe.blogspot.com/2012/12/koma-kulshan-mysterious-mountain-moniker.html">the term used</a> by the Lhaq&#8217;temish (Lummi) people around Bellingham and the San Juan Islands, or <em>swáʔlәx̣</em>, <a href="https://lingpapers.sites.olt.ubc.ca/#icsnl-xxxii-1997-25">reportedly used</a> by the nəxʷsƛ̕áy̕əm̕ (Klallam) people on the Olympic Peninsula.</p>



<p>The mountain itself is surrounded by the traditional lands of the Nooksack and Upper Skagit peoples. The Nooksack use <em>kwelshán</em> for the high open slopes of the mountain and <em>kweq’ smánit</em> for the glacier-covered summit.</p>

Both stations were powered by water delivered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penstock">penstocks</a> from Buntzen Lake, which in turn was supplied with water from Coquitlam Lake via a 4km-long tunnel.</p>
<p>Buntzen station #1 <a href="https://www.bchydro.com/energy-in-bc/operations/our-facilities/lower-mainland.html">is still functional</a> and supplies 60 megawatts of power to the Metro Vancouver area.

<p>Three main topological features define how water flows in the Vancouver-Burnaby-New West area:</p>
<ul>
<li>a chain of hills running along səl̓ilw̓ət (Burrard Inlet) from East Vancouver to Coquitlam, including Capitol Hill and lhuḵw’lkuḵw’áyten (Burnaby Mountain);</li>
<li>a ridge extending from t̕θəcəliʔqʷ (UBC) to sχʷeyəməɬ (New Westminster) along the southern half of the peninsula, with peaks at Little Mountain and the Metrotown area; and</li>
<li>weirdly enough, a barely perceptible incline between Nanaimo Street and Renfrew Street in East Vancouver.</li>
</ul>
<p>These features divide the Burrard Peninsula into four watersheds, which determine where a falling raindrop will flow</p>
<ul>
<li>north, into səl̓ilw̓ət (Burrard Inlet),</li>
<li>northwest, into False Creek/English Bay,</li>
<li>south, into stal̓əw̓ (the Fraser River), or</li>

<p>Although the name is better than a few others in the Pacific Northwest, being the first person to see a giant mountain isn’t a particularly notable claim to fame. Especially when you have to ignore not only tens of thousands of people who lived there but also the Spaniards who had <a href="https://text-message.blogs.archives.gov/2017/10/12/225-years-ago-spanish-explorations-of-the-pacific-northwest-and-the-first-spanish-settlement-in-washington-state-nunez-gaona-neah-bay-1792-part-ii-spanish-explorations-of-the-pacific-northwest-a/">gotten there the year prior</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The mountain appears as <em>la gran montaña del Carmelo</em> on <a href="https://doi.org/10.58066/a0dr-8a54">a map</a> drawn by Gonzalo Lopez de Haro, first pilot on Manuel Quimper’s six-week expedition to the Juan de Fuca strait. The Spanish name is apparently a reference to a religious order whose white cloaks resembled the snow-capped peak. Who knows, if the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootka_Crisis">Nootka Crisis</a> had been resolved differently, it’s entirely possible that Europeans would have ended up calling it Monte Carmelo.</p>
<p>Instead, the name Mount Baker stuck after Vancouver described it in his published memoir.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>About this time a very high conspicuous craggy mountain … presented itself, towering above the clouds: as low down as they allowed it to be visible it was covered with snow; and south of it, was a long ridge of very rugged snowy mountains, much less elevated, which seemed to stretch to a considerable distance … the high distant land formed, as already observed, like detached islands, amongst which the lofty mountain, discovered in the afternoon by the third lieutenant, and in compliment to him called by me Mount Baker, rose a very conspicuous object … apparently at a very remote distance.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/voyageofdiscover01vanc">George Vancouver</a></p>

<p>The mountain itself is surrounded by the traditional lands of the Nooksack and Upper Skagit peoples. The Nooksack use <em>kwelshán</em> for the high open slopes of the mountain and <em>kweq’ smánit</em> for the glacier-covered summit.</p>

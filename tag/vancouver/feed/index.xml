<p>I recently went for a walk in təmtəmíxʷtən (Belcarra), and when I got to… wait, what’s that weird derelict building in the distance?</p>



<span id="more-151"></span>



<p>Is it an abandoned hotel? No, there’s no way to get there by land. An old naval fortress? No, the location doesn’t make any strategic sense. A hydroelectric dam? Where’s the water behind it?</p>



<p>As it turns out, it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a power plant!&nbsp;<a href="https://montecristomagazine.com/community/the-buntzen-lake-powerhouses">Buntzen generating station #2</a>, completed in 1914, was built to supplement the output of BC’s first-ever hydroelectric plant up-inlet. Both stations were powered by water delivered by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penstock">penstocks</a>&nbsp;from Buntzen Lake, which in turn was supplied with water from Coquitlam Lake via a 4km-long tunnel.</p>



<p>Buntzen station #1&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bchydro.com/energy-in-bc/operations/our-facilities/lower-mainland.html">is still functional</a>&nbsp;and supplies 60 megawatts of power to the Metro Vancouver area. Buntzen #2 was shut down at the turn of the millennium and serves as a historic curiosity for kayakers in səl̓ilw̓ət (Indian Arm).</p>

<p><a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2016-02-29-land-use/index.html">Jens von Bergmann</a> has run the numbers on land use in various municipalities in Metro Vancouver. The City of Vancouver in particular has <em>lot</em> of land tied up in streets and detached housing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th>Use</th><th>CoV land</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>single-family detached houses and duplexes</td><td>34.0%</td></tr><tr><td>roads and right-of-way</td><td>28.1%</td></tr><tr><td>recreation, open space, and natural areas</td><td>15.2%</td></tr><tr><td>commercial</td><td>3.9%</td></tr><tr><td>low-rise apartments (residential or mixed-use)</td><td>4.1%</td></tr><tr><td>high-rise apartments (residential or mixed-use)</td><td>1.9%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Because the City of Vancouver has so little area left undeveloped, any proposals for new housing, schools, parks, stores, and so forth will displace some existing use of the land.</p>

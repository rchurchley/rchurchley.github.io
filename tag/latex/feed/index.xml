<p>Owl was designed with three guiding principles in mind:</p>



<p><strong>Simple colours = no distractions</strong></p>



<p>Owl uses black, white, and slight grey tones for the structural elements of each Beamer frame, putting the focus of each slide on your content.</p>



<p><strong>Dark and bright rooms, dark and light themes</strong></p>



<p>A white background is best for visibility in brightly-lit rooms, whereas a black one can be easier on the eyes in rooms with low ambient lighting. Owl provides both dark and light themes, easily configurable with the package options.</p>



<p><strong>A palette optimized for common projectors</strong></p>



<p>Business and university projectors are often calibrated with an extremely bright green channel and very dim red and blue channels. Owl redefines the basic colour names <code>red</code>, <code>green</code>, <code>blue</code>, <code>yellow</code>, <code>violet</code>, <code>brown</code>, <code>orange</code>, and <code>cyan</code> to attractive hues that are still visible on these projectors.</p>



<p>Owl is available <a href="https://www.ctan.org/pkg/beamercolorthemeowl">on CTAN</a> and comes bundled with the latest TeX Live distribution.</p>

<p>Ever wonder why LaTeX doesn&#8217;t provide a way for printing the title and author once <code>\maketitle</code> has been issued? I did. So I asked a question on the TeX StackExchange and received an interesting answer. Turns out it&#8217;s an artifact of the times when memory was in <em>extremely</em> short supply.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The main reason was &#8220;main-memory&#8221; back in those days. LaTeX was effectively eating up half of the available space just through macro definitions. So with complicated pages or with some picture environments etc you could hit the limit. So freeing up any bit was essential and you still see traces of this in the code.</p>
<cite><a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/68045/why-are-title-author-and-date-cleared-during-maketitle">Frank Mittelbac</a>h</cite></blockquote>

<p>Julius Caesar’s given name was Gaius. &#8220;Julius&#8221; and &#8220;Caesar&#8221; were both family names (Caesar being a branch of the Julia family).</p>



<p>In his time, he was referred to as&nbsp;<em>Gaius Caesar</em> or simply as <em>Caesar</em> by <a href="https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Commentarii_de_bello_Gallico">himself</a> and <a href="https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Pro_Marcello">his contemporaries</a>. Calling him &#8220;Julius Caesar&#8221; would have been redundant since every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julii_Caesares">Caesar</a> was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_gens">Julius</a>.</p>



<p>The Romans had a lot of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_naming_conventions">traditions</a>&nbsp;around names.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Julius_Caesar_(name)">Gaius Julius Caesar</a>&nbsp;inherited his name from his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.</p>



<p>Caesar’s great-nephew&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Gaius Octavius Thurinus</a>&nbsp;also took the name Gaius Julius Caesar when he inherited the assassinated dictator’s estate. To prevent confusion, he’s often called&nbsp;<em>Octavianus</em>, which is more or less the ancient Roman equivalent to &#8220;the artist formerly known as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)">Prince</a>&#8220;. The emperor&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula">Caligula</a>, Octavian’s great-grandson, was also named Gaius Caesar; we know him by a nickname he received as a small child.</p>

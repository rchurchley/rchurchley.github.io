<p>In the late &#8217;60s, the government sought to adopt <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Canada"><em>O Canada</em></a> as the national anthem. The music and original French lyrics had passed into the public domain, but the English version was still under copyright. The government settled the rights <a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/o-canada">for a dollar</a>.</p>



<p>Ironically, the copyright to the English lyrics would have expired anyways by the time the <em>National Anthem Act</em> was finally passed in 1980.</p>

<p>Crayola has a trademark on the smell of its crayons.</p>



<p>The odour is described in the Canadian trademarks registry as:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>A unique scent of a pungent, aldehydic fragrance combined with the faint scent of a hydrocarbon wax and an earthy clay.</p>
<cite><a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/cipo/trademark-search/1986544">Trademark 1986544</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>In Canada, a trademark can be anything that is used by by a seller to distinguish their goods or services from those of others, including</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>a word, a personal name, a design, a letter, a numeral, a colour, a figurative element, a three-dimensional shape, a hologram, a moving image, a mode of packaging goods, a sound, a scent, a taste, a texture and the positioning of a sign.</p>
<cite><a href="https://www.laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/t-13/FullText.html">Trademarks Act</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Unfortunately, I have not been able to find records of anyone litigating over a scent trademark.</p>

<p>In the late &#8217;60s, the government sought to adopt <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Canada"><em>O Canada</em></a> as the national anthem. The music and original French lyrics had passed into the public domain, but the English version was still under copyright. The government settled the rights <a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/o-canada">for a dollar</a>.</p>



<p>Ironically, the copyright to the English lyrics would have expired anyways by the time the <em>National Anthem Act</em> was finally passed in 1980.</p>

<p>Crayola has a trademark on the <em>smell</em> of its crayons. The odour is described in the Canadian trademarks registry as:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>A unique scent of a pungent, aldehydic fragrance combined with the faint scent of a hydrocarbon wax and an earthy clay.</p>

<p>In Canada, a trademark can be anything that is used by by a seller to distinguish their goods or services from those of others, including</p>

<p>a word, a personal name, a design, a letter, a numeral, a colour, a figurative element, a three-dimensional shape, a hologram, a moving image, a mode of packaging goods, a sound, a scent, a taste, a texture and the positioning of a sign.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have not been able to find records of anyone litigating over a scent trademark.</p>

<p><em>Rupa Marya v. Warner Chappell Music</em> was fought over the copyright status of the song &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Birthday_to_You">Happy Birthday to You</a>&#8220;. A key factor in the order for summary judgement came in this all-time great quote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Obviously, pianos do not sing.</p>
</blockquote>



<span id="more-283"></span>



<p>At the time of lawsuit, Warner was collecting royalties — around $2 million a year — for &#8220;Happy Birthday to You&#8221; despite the fact that the melody<sup data-fn="2732db1e-a16a-48f1-8f6b-48de02c94470" class="fn"><a href="#2732db1e-a16a-48f1-8f6b-48de02c94470" id="2732db1e-a16a-48f1-8f6b-48de02c94470-link">1</a></sup> was in the American public domain. They claimed that the lyrics were still under copyright and that they owned the rights to them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="866" height="297" src="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/happy-birthday-music.webp" alt="Sheet music for Happy Birthday to You" class="wp-image-688" srcset="https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/happy-birthday-music.webp 866w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/happy-birthday-music-800x274.webp 800w, https://rosschurchley.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/happy-birthday-music-768x263.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 866px) 100vw, 866px" /></figure>



<p>Although Warner had acquired <em>some</em> &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221;-related rights, it wasn&#8217;t clear what those rights covered since the original transfer agreements had been lost. This presented some difficulty for Warner&#8217;s argument, which required them to prove that their rights included the lyrics specifically. Since the agreement had been described as covering &#8220;piano arrangements&#8221;, the judge reasoned:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Obviously, pianos do not sing. Thus, it is not logical to infer that rights to &#8220;piano arrangements&#8221; would include rights to any lyrics or words at all.</p>
<cite><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4150219/rupa-marya-v-warner-chappell-music-inc/">George H King</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>The final ruling was that Warner could not prove that it owned the copyright to the &#8220;Happy Birthday to You&#8221; lyrics, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1111624#">assuming they were still under copyright at all</a>. Settlement terms following the summary judgement definitively assigned the song to the American public domain.</p>



<p>As far as I can tell, the European copyright to both the &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; lyrics and melody would have been still valid, albeit with disputed ownership, until it expired in 2017. Meanwhile here in Canada, the song had already passed to the public domain in 1997.</p>


<ol class="wp-block-footnotes"><li id="2732db1e-a16a-48f1-8f6b-48de02c94470">The song was originally published as &#8220;Good Morning to All&#8221; with different lyrics. <a href="#2732db1e-a16a-48f1-8f6b-48de02c94470-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote reference 1"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />︎</a></li></ol>]]></content:encoded>

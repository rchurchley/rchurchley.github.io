It was my first time at a baseball game, so I recorded a bunch of observations about the experience.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="the-stadium-experience">The stadium experience</h2>
<p>This was my first time attending any professional sport in person, so I didn’t have any idea what to expect. I checked the <a href="https://www.mlb.com/mariners/ballpark/information/guide">stadium rules</a> in advance and found I could bring my camera, but not my camera bag or any of my larger lenses. Fortunately, my wide-angle lens and 20–55mm kit lens — both barely within the regulations — were enough to get some interesting photos.</p>
<p>A big part of the ballpark experience is being able to wander around the stadium; I spent at least half the game exploring rather than sitting in my assigned seat. There’s a lot to look at and do in the stadium, and as long as you’re not blocking anyone’s view during an at-bat, there’s remarkable freedom to walk around the aisles and see the field from different angles.</p>

<h2 id="baseball-is-complicated">Baseball is complicated</h2>
<p>Many of the Microsoft employees at the game — including myself — are more familiar with cricket than with baseball. Cricket has a reputation in North America for being hard to understand, but when I compare my <a href="http://echizen.local/2024/cricket-in-600-words-or-less/">beginner’s guide to cricket</a> with our deliberations our section had to understand what was going on, I realized that baseball is <em>much</em> more complicated.</p>

<p>Can you decipher these scoreboards?</p>
<details class="astro-vg66d3uy"> <summary class="astro-vg66d3uy">Answer key (bottom section)</summary> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_zone">Balls, strikes</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)">outs</a> are fundamental to the game, relatively easy to explain to a newcomer, and mercifully unabbreviated on the bottom right of the scoreboard.</p><p>Each team’s current score is the total number of runs under the “R” column; columns 1–9 show how many runs were scored in each inning. The “H” column counts the number of hits resulting on a runner on base due to the batting team’s efforts; the “E” column counts the number of errors by the fielding team that allowed their opponent to get a runner on base.</p><p>I had no idea what the acronym “MVR” stood for until a colleague expanded it to “mound visits remaining”; this refers to a kind of time out the fielding team can take to discuss strategy or switch pitchers.</p> </details> 
<details class="astro-vg66d3uy"> <summary class="astro-vg66d3uy">Answer key (side sections)</summary> <p>The sides of the scoreboard display the current lineup of each team with jersey numbers and positions; the highlighted name tells you whose turn it is to bat. The batting lineup shows one other piece of information for each player:</p><ul>
<li>For players that have not yet batted in the inning, it shows the batting average.</li>
<li>For players that have batted already in the inning, it shows a <a href="https://www.mlb.com/glossary/miscellaneous/scorekeeping">cryptic acronym</a> that tells you the result of their at-bat.</li>
<li>For pitchers (who do not bat), I think it shows the pitcher’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average">earned runs average</a> (ERA) which is its own whole thing.</li>
</ul><p>On the right-hand side of the first scoreboard, we see that the name highlighted in yellow is the current batter, Seattle’s Dominic Canzone, who wears number 8 on his jersey, plays left field, and has a batting average of .219.</p><p>The three Seattle players above Canzone have already batted this inning. Center fielder Raleigh had a single (recorded as “1B”), as did right fielder Raley. First baseman France is listed as having a “P3” which is apparently the acronym for “out after hitting a pop fly which was caught by the first baseman.”</p> </details> 
<details class="astro-vg66d3uy"> <summary class="astro-vg66d3uy">Answer key (middle section, first scoreboard)</summary> <p>The middle of the first scoreboard shows the statistics of the current batter.

<details class="astro-vg66d3uy"> <summary class="astro-vg66d3uy">Answer key (scoring decision, second scoreboard)</summary> <p>Now we just need to figure out what “FC, E5, No RBI” is supposed to mean. This was displayed on the jumbotron after the following play:</p><figure> <video src="/_astro/marsh-to-urias.BzCp5qpb.mp4" controls loop muted></video> <figcaption></figcaption> </figure><p>“FC” stands for “fielder’s choice”, meaning that the third baseman chose to try to get the out at third instead of throwing it to first. This means the hit doesn’t count towards the batter’s statistics. The “E5” means the scorer decided that the Seattle players were safe because of the third baseman’s error.</p><p>Finally, the run that scored during the play does not count as an RBI for the batter because if it weren’t for the error, there would have been three outs and the runner wouldn’t have scored.</p> </details>

<p>Before I came to the game I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLU9C9rstIA">a video</a> about camera assignments at professional baseball games and I had fun finding the camera operators at high first, low first, and center field.</p>

But I’m really glad to have gone once. It was a lot of fun to explore the stadium and see a few glimpses of what goes in to putting on a baseball game. Thanks Microsoft for bringing me to a fun event!</p>

<p>As it turns out, it <em>is</em> a power plant! <a href="https://montecristomagazine.com/community/the-buntzen-lake-powerhouses">Buntzen generating station #2</a>, completed in 1914, was built to supplement the output of BC’s first-ever hydroelectric plant up-inlet. Both stations were powered by water delivered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penstock">penstocks</a> from Buntzen Lake, which in turn was supplied with water from Coquitlam Lake via a 4km-long tunnel.</p>
<p>Buntzen station #1 <a href="https://www.bchydro.com/energy-in-bc/operations/our-facilities/lower-mainland.html">is still functional</a> and supplies 60 megawatts of power to the Metro Vancouver area. Buntzen #2 was shut down at the turn of the millennium and serves as a historic curiosity for kayakers in səl̓ilw̓ət (Indian Arm).</p>

<hr/>
<p>If you look into Hyrule’s sky at night, you’ll see the <strong>stars do not move</strong> while the moon races from one horizon to the other.</p>
<figure> <video src="/_astro/moon.BZaGi0zR.mp4" controls loop muted></video> <figcaption></figcaption> </figure>
<p>This means that the cosmology of the <em>Zelda</em> universe is significantly different from our own; if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_Revolution">Copernicus</a> was Hylian he’d have to give up on the heliocentric model.<sup id="fnref:1" class="astro-ogpmuyat"><a class="fn-ref astro-ogpmuyat" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> </p>
<p>That’s not the only astronomical oddity in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. <strong>The sun’s position at sunrise and sunset doesn’t make sense</strong>. On Earth, the sun doesn’t always rise and set <em>exactly</em> in the east and west. In the (boreal) summer, the sun rises and sets further north, providing us in the Northern Hemisphere with more hours of sunlight each day.</p>
<p>Here in the Vancouver summer, the sun currently rises 38° north of east and sets 38° north of west. In <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> the sun rises around 4:00 and sets around 9:00,<sup id="fnref:2" class="astro-ogpmuyat"><a class="fn-ref astro-ogpmuyat" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>  so you’d expect them to happen at similar angles instead of due east and west.</p>
<p>This is more evidence towards a geocentric model of Hylian cosmology, since the timing and position of sunrise and set can be explained if the sun orbits a point directly above Hyrule.</p>
<figure> <video src="/_astro/24hours.DTI8Qy7L.mp4" controls loop muted></video> <figcaption></figcaption> </figure>
<p>The strangest phenomenon I noticed is the fact that <strong>moon only appears at night</strong>. Sure, we culturally associate the moon with night, but in reality it’s out during the day half the time. This is what gives the moon <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/moon/moon-phases/">its phases</a>; the closer the moon is to the sun in the sky, the less of it appears illuminated to us on Earth. If the moon always rises and sets at the same time of day, its phases cannot be explained as the reflected light of the sun!</p>
<p>The simplest explanation would be that Link is observing the rotation of a moon with one luminescent side, but I looked closely and the half-moon has the same face as the full moon. This means that, like Earth’s moon, the Hylian moon is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking">tidally locked</a><sup id="fnref:3" class="astro-ogpmuyat"><a class="fn-ref astro-ogpmuyat" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>  and always shows the same face.</p>

<p>My best theory is that the moon is made of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence">fluorescent</a> material and is orbited by a small body that emits ultraviolet or other high-energy light in the non-visible spectrum. Do you have an alternative headcanon theory?</p>

Can you guess which is which?</p>
<hr/>
<p>I would have guessed that the trees might be related to a woody rose bush, while the leafy greens would be closer to broad-leaved sunflowers. I would have been wrong. Plants are <em>much</em> weirder than that.</p>
<p>In fact, cabbages are much more closely related to maple trees than they are to lettuce; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica_oleracea">cabbage</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple">maples</a> are both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosids">rosids</a>.

<p>As it turns out, a lot of the categories we use to think about plants — trees, bushes, berries, vegetables, and so on — are not particularly unique from an genetic perspective. Biologist Georgia Ray <a href="https://eukaryotewritesblog.com/2021/05/02/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-tree/">explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the evolutionary tree of plants, trees are regularly interspersed with things that are <em>absolutely, 100%</em> not trees. This means that, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>The common ancestor of a maple and a mulberry tree was not a tree.</li>
<li>The common ancestor of a stinging nettle and a strawberry plant was a tree.</li>
<li>And this is true for most trees or non-trees that you can think of.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of this, there are plenty of plant lists you can play “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_of_These_Things_(Is_Not_Like_the_Others)">One of these things is not like the others</a>” with where the intuitive answer is very different from the phylogenetic answer.</p>

<p>The interest in dinosaurs is even stronger than the Google Trends comparisons suggest. People do not search for news on dinosaur attacks, as they would on sharks, lions, snakes, and alligators.

<li>The responsibility for preventing deaths and injuries on the road transportation system partly rests with the people who design that infrastructure, and</li>
<li>Deaths and injuries on the road ultimately come down to kinetic energy.</li>
</ol>
<p>The picture is intended to turn the kinetic energy of a moving car into a height to show the consequences of simple human mistakes in the road system. Research shows that the highest acceptable speed on a street with active users like this is 30km/h.</p>

<p>The image has been widely shared, thanks in part to <a href="https://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/11/18/7236471/cars-pedestrians-sidewalks-roads">a 2014 Vox article</a> that used it to call attention to other pedestrian-hostile aspects about many cities’ street designs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most roads in the US are built for cars, not for pedestrians. This brilliant illustration shows just how lopsided the the proportions of a normal urban street corner really are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The city sidewalk picture is just one of a series of four that Jilg illustrated for the Swedish government. The other one I found is set on a highway.</p>
<astro-figure> <figure> <a href="/_astro/jilg-canyon.C-RWup8f_ZRKWs7.webp" data-pswp-width="600" data-pswp-height="800"> <img src="/_astro/jilg-canyon.C-RWup8f_ZRKWs7.webp" srcset="/_astro/jilg-canyon.C-RWup8f_ZRKWs7.webp 600w" alt="An illustration of a car speeding along a road high in the mountains" width="600" height="800" loading="lazy" decoding="async"> </a> <figcaption><p>A car moving at highway speeds has a lot of kinetic energy.

<p>I’m not sure whether Jilg did any calculations to create these, but a head-on collision between two cars at highway speed is approximately equivalent to a single car being dropped from a height of 200m. Sweden added median barriers to many highways in the late ’90s, which reduced the incidence of head-on collisions and the risk of fatalities by 80%.</p>
<p>I have unfortunately not been able to find the other two illustrations in the set. Jilg has, however, done other work for the Swedish government.</p>

<p>Since it would be wasteful (not to mention expensive) to buy new cards every time we play, we only buy a certain number of packs each set and re-use the cards we open to make our own packs for later games.</p>

<p>We originally tried coin envelopes and a product called <a href="https://hitpointpress.com/collections/thingamajigs">Cubeamajigs</a>, but neither was as nice or convenient as the side-loading papercraft boxes I made with my <a href="https://cricut.com/en-ca/">Cricut</a>.</p>
<p>The above SVG image can be imported into Cricut Design Space to make boxes of your own. Or, if you want to make a box with different dimensions, a tool called <a href="https://www.templatemaker.nl/en/cardbox/">Templatemaker</a> can make similar patterns.</p> </div> </section>     <a class="post-card-meta astro-2hamjdxn" href="/2022/cricut-made-magic-the-gathering-packs/"> <time datetime="2022-12-01T08:00:00.000Z"> 2022-12-01 </time> </a> </article>  </li> </ul>   </main> <nav class="pagination astro-ohesw4vm"><a href="/blog/2" class="astro-ohesw4vm">Previous page</a><a href="/blog/4" class="astro-ohesw4vm">Next page</a></nav>  <footer id="site-footer" class="astro-hxndjxm7">
